
   Here in the dark, O heart;
   Alone with the enduring Earth, and Night,
   And Silence, and the warm strange smell of clover;
   Clear-visioned, though it break you; far apart
   From the dead best, the dear and old delight;
   Throw down your dreams of immortality,
   O faithful, O foolish lover!
   Here's peace for you, and surety; here the one
   Wisdom -- the truth! -- "All day the good glad sun
   Showers love and labour on you, wine and song;
   The greenwood laughs, the wind blows, all day long
   Till night."  And night ends all things.
                                             Then shall be
   No lamp relumed in heaven, no voices crying,
   Or changing lights, or dreams and forms that hover!
   (And, heart, for all your sighing,
   That gladness and those tears are over, over. . . .)

   And has the truth brought no new hope at all,
   Heart, that you're weeping yet for Paradise?
   Do they still whisper, the old weary cries?
   "'MID YOUTH AND SONG, FEASTING AND CARNIVAL,
   THROUGH LAUGHTER, THROUGH THE ROSES, AS OF OLD
   COMES DEATH, ON SHADOWY AND RELENTLESS FEET,
   DEATH, UNAPPEASABLE BY PRAYER OR GOLD;
   DEATH IS THE END, THE END!"
   Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet
   Death as a friend!

   Exile of immortality, strongly wise,
   Strain through the dark with undesirous eyes
   To what may lie beyond it.  Sets your star,
   O heart, for ever!  Yet, behind the night,
   Waits for the great unborn, somewhere afar,
   Some white tremendous daybreak.  And the light,
   Returning, shall give back the golden hours,
   Ocean a windless level, Earth a lawn
   Spacious and full of sunlit dancing-places,
   And laughter, and music, and, among the flowers,
   The gay child-hearts of men, and the child-faces
   O heart, in the great dawn!

   Tenderly, day that I have loved, I close your eyes,
    And smooth your quiet brow, and fold your thin dead hands.
   The grey veils of the half-light deepen; colour dies.
    I bear you, a light burden, to the shrouded sands,

   Where lies your waiting boat, by wreaths of the sea's making
    Mist-garlanded, with all grey weeds of the water crowned.
   There you'll be laid, past fear of sleep or hope of waking;
    And over the unmoving sea, without a sound,

   Faint hands will row you outward, out beyond our sight,
    Us with stretched arms and empty eyes on the far-gleaming
   And marble sand. . . .
                           Beyond the shifting cold twilight,
    Further than laughter goes, or tears, further than dreaming,
   There'll be no port, no dawn-lit islands!  But the drear
    Waste darkening, and, at length, flame ultimate on the deep.
   Oh, the last fire -- and you, unkissed, unfriended there!
    Oh, the lone way's red ending, and we not there to weep!

   (We found you pale and quiet, and strangely crowned with flowers,
    Lovely and secret as a child.  You came with us,
   Came happily, hand in hand with the young dancing hours,
    High on the downs at dawn!)  Void now and tenebrous,

   The grey sands curve before me. . . .
                                          From the inland meadows,
    Fragrant of June and clover, floats the dark, and fills
   The hollow sea's dead face with little creeping shadows,
    And the white silence brims the hollow of the hills.

   Close in the nest is folded every weary wing,
    Hushed all the joyful voices; and we, who held you dear,
   Eastward we turn and homeward, alone, remembering . . .
    Day that I loved, day that I loved, the Night is here!

   They sleep within. . . .
   I cower to the earth, I waking, I only.
   High and cold thou dreamest, O queen, high-dreaming and lonely.

   We have slept too long, who can hardly win
   The white one flame, and the night-long crying;
   The viewless passers; the world's low sighing
   With desire, with yearning,
   To the fire unburning,
   To the heatless fire, to the flameless ecstasy! . . .

   Helpless I lie.
   And around me the feet of thy watchers tread.
   There is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head,
   An intolerable radiance of wings. . . .

   All the earth grows fire,
   White lips of desire
   Brushing cool on the forehead, croon slumbrous things.
   Earth fades; and the air is thrilled with ways,
   Dewy paths full of comfort.  And radiant bands,
   The gracious presence of friendly hands,
   Help the blind one, the glad one, who stumbles and strays,
   Stretching wavering hands, up, up, through the praise
   Of a myriad silver trumpets, through cries,
   To all glory, to all gladness, to the infinite height,
   To the gracious, the unmoving, the mother eyes,
   And the laughter, and the lips, of light.

   Lo! from quiet skies
   In through the window my Lord the Sun!
   And my eyes
   Were dazzled and drunk with the misty gold,
   The golden glory that drowned and crowned me
   Eddied and swayed through the room . . .
                                             Around me,
   To left and to right,
   Hunched figures and old,
   Dull blear-eyed scribbling fools, grew fair,
   Ringed round and haloed with holy light.
   Flame lit on their hair,
   And their burning eyes grew young and wise,
   Each as a God, or King of kings,
   White-robed and bright
   (Still scribbling all);
   And a full tumultuous murmur of wings
   Grew through the hall;
   And I knew the white undying Fire,
   And, through open portals,
   Gyre on gyre,
   Archangels and angels, adoring, bowing,
   And a Face unshaded . . .
   Till the light faded;
   And they were but fools again, fools unknowing,
   Still scribbling, blear-eyed and stolid immortals.

   I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
   And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
   And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.

   And in them all was only the old cry,
   That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
   You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
   O silly lover!"
   And I was tired and sick that all was over,
   And because I,
   For all my thinking, never could recover
   One moment of the good hours that were over.
   And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

   Then from the sad west turning wearily,
   I saw the pines against the white north sky,
   Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
   Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
   And there was peace in them; and I
   Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
   And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
   Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!

   Creeps in half wanton, half asleep,
    One with a fat wide hairless face.
   He likes love-music that is cheap;
    Likes women in a crowded place;
     And wants to hear the noise they're making.

   His heavy eyelids droop half-over,
    Great pouches swing beneath his eyes.
   He listens, thinks himself the lover,
    Heaves from his stomach wheezy sighs;
     He likes to feel his heart's a-breaking.

   The music swells.  His gross legs quiver.
    His little lips are bright with slime.
   The music swells.  The women shiver.
    And all the while, in perfect time,
     His pendulous stomach hangs a-shaking.

   Slowly up silent peaks, the white edge of the world,
    Trod four archangels, clear against the unheeding sky,
   Bearing, with quiet even steps, and great wings furled,
    A little dingy coffin; where a child must lie,
   It was so tiny.  (Yet, you had fancied, God could never
    Have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight,
   And shut him in that lonely shell, to drop for ever
    Into the emptiness and silence, into the night. . . .)

   They then from the sheer summit cast, and watched it fall,
    Through unknown glooms, that frail black coffin -- and therein
    God's little pitiful Body lying, worn and thin,
   And curled up like some crumpled, lonely flower-petal --
   Till it was no more visible; then turned again
   With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain.

   Swiftly out from the friendly lilt of the band,
    The crowd's good laughter, the loved eyes of men,
    I am drawn nightward; I must turn again
   Where, down beyond the low untrodden strand,
   There curves and glimmers outward to the unknown
    The old unquiet ocean.  All the shade
   Is rife with magic and movement.  I stray alone
    Here on the edge of silence, half afraid,

   Waiting a sign.  In the deep heart of me
   The sullen waters swell towards the moon,
   And all my tides set seaward.
                                  From inland
   Leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tune,
   That tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand,
   And dies between the seawall and the sea.

   What light of unremembered skies
   Hast thou relumed within our eyes,
   Thou whom we seek, whom we shall find? . . .
   A certain odour on the wind,
   Thy hidden face beyond the west,
   These things have called us; on a quest
   Older than any road we trod,
   More endless than desire. . . .
                                    Far God,
   Sigh with thy cruel voice, that fills
   The soul with longing for dim hills
   And faint horizons!  For there come
   Grey moments of the antient dumb
   Sickness of travel, when no song
   Can cheer us; but the way seems long;
   And one remembers. . . .
                             Ah! the beat
   Of weary unreturning feet,
   And songs of pilgrims unreturning! . . .
   The fires we left are always burning
   On the old shrines of home.  Our kin
   Have built them temples, and therein
   Pray to the Gods we know; and dwell
   In little houses lovable,
   Being happy (we remember how!)
   And peaceful even to death. . . .
                                      O Thou,
   God of all long desirous roaming,
   Our hearts are sick of fruitless homing,
   And crying after lost desire.
   Hearten us onward! as with fire
   Consuming dreams of other bliss.
   The best Thou givest, giving this
   Sufficient thing -- to travel still
   Over the plain, beyond the hill,
   Unhesitating through the shade,
   Amid the silence unafraid,
   Till, at some sudden turn, one sees
   Against the black and muttering trees
   Thine altar, wonderfully white,
   Among the Forests of the Night.

   Come away!  Come away!
   Ye are sober and dull through the common day,
   But now it is night!
   It is shameful night, and God is asleep!
   (Have you not felt the quick fires that creep
   Through the hungry flesh, and the lust of delight,
   And hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say?).
       The house is dumb;
   The night calls out to you.        Come, ah, come!
   Down the dim stairs, through the creaking door,
   Naked, crawling on hands and feet
   -- It is meet! it is meet!
   Ye are men no longer, but less and more,
   Beast and God. . . .  Down the lampless street,
   By little black ways, and secret places,
   In the darkness and mire,
   Faint laughter around, and evil faces
   By the star-glint seen -- ah! follow with us!
   For the darkness whispers a blind desire,
   And the fingers of night are amorous.
   Keep close as we speed,
   Though mad whispers woo you, and hot hands cling,
   And the touch and the smell of bare flesh sting,
   Soft flank by your flank, and side brushing side --
   TO-NIGHT never heed!
   Unswerving and silent follow with me,
   Till the city ends sheer,
   And the crook'd lanes open wide,
   Out of the voices of night,
   Beyond lust and fear,
   To the level waters of moonlight,
   To the level waters, quiet and clear,
   To the black unresting plains of the calling sea.

   Because God put His adamantine fate
    Between my sullen heart and its desire,
   I swore that I would burst the Iron Gate,
    Rise up, and curse Him on His throne of fire.
   Earth shuddered at my crown of blasphemy,
    But Love was as a flame about my feet;
    Proud up the Golden Stair I strode; and beat
   Thrice on the Gate, and entered with a cry --

   All the great courts were quiet in the sun,
    And full of vacant echoes:  moss had grown
   Over the glassy pavement, and begun
    To creep within the dusty council-halls.
   An idle wind blew round an empty throne
    And stirred the heavy curtains on the walls.

   Before thy shrine I kneel, an unknown worshipper,
    Chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies,
   Incense of dirges, prayers that are as holy myrrh.

   Ah, goddess, on thy throne of tears and faint low sighs,
    Weary at last to theeward come the feet that err,
   And empty hearts grown tired of the world's vanities.

   How fair this cool deep silence to a wanderer
    Deaf with the roar of winds along the open skies!
   Sweet, after sting and bitter kiss of sea-water,

   The pale Lethean wine within thy chalices!
    I come before thee, I, too tired wanderer,
   To heed the horror of the shrine, the distant cries,

   And evil whispers in the gloom, or the swift whirr
    Of terrible wings -- I, least of all thy votaries,
   With a faint hope to see the scented darkness stir,

   And, parting, frame within its quiet mysteries
    One face, with lips than autumn-lilies tenderer,
   And voice more sweet than the far plaint of viols is,

    Or the soft moan of any grey-eyed lute-player.

   Opposite me two Germans snore and sweat.
    Through sullen swirling gloom we jolt and roar.
   We have been here for ever:  even yet
    A dim watch tells two hours, two aeons, more.
   The windows are tight-shut and slimy-wet
    With a night's foetor.  There are two hours more;
   Two hours to dawn and Milan; two hours yet.
   Opposite me two Germans sweat and snore. . . .

   One of them wakes, and spits, and sleeps again.
    The darkness shivers.  A wan light through the rain
   Strikes on our faces, drawn and white.  Somewhere
    A new day sprawls; and, inside, the foul air
   Is chill, and damp, and fouler than before. . . .
   Opposite me two Germans sweat and snore.

   Out of the nothingness of sleep,
    The slow dreams of Eternity,
   There was a thunder on the deep:
    I came, because you called to me.

   I broke the Night's primeval bars,
    I dared the old abysmal curse,
   And flashed through ranks of frightened stars
    Suddenly on the universe!

   The eternal silences were broken;
    Hell became Heaven as I passed. --
   What shall I give you as a token,
    A sign that we have met, at last?

   I'll break and forge the stars anew,
    Shatter the heavens with a song;
   Immortal in my love for you,
    Because I love you, very strong.

   Your mouth shall mock the old and wise,
    Your laugh shall fill the world with flame,
   I'll write upon the shrinking skies
    The scarlet splendour of your name,

   Till Heaven cracks, and Hell thereunder
    Dies in her ultimate mad fire,
   And darkness falls, with scornful thunder,
    On dreams of men and men's desire.

   Then only in the empty spaces,
    Death, walking very silently,
   Shall fear the glory of our faces
    Through all the dark infinity.

   So, clothed about with perfect love,
    The eternal end shall find us one,
   Alone above the Night, above
    The dust of the dead gods, alone.

   Is it the hour?  We leave this resting-place
    Made fair by one another for a while.
   Now, for a god-speed, one last mad embrace;
    The long road then, unlit by your faint smile.
   Ah! the long road! and you so far away!
   Oh, I'll remember! but . . . each crawling day
   Will pale a little your scarlet lips, each mile
    Dull the dear pain of your remembered face.

   . . . Do you think there's a far border town, somewhere,
    The desert's edge, last of the lands we know,
       Some gaunt eventual limit of our light,
    In which I'll find you waiting; and we'll go
   Together, hand in hand again, out there,
       Into the waste we know not, into the night?

   Some day I shall rise and leave my friends
   And seek you again through the world's far ends,
   You whom I found so fair
   (Touch of your hands and smell of your hair!),
   My only god in the days that were.
   My eager feet shall find you again,
   Though the sullen years and the mark of pain
   Have changed you wholly; for I shall know
   (How could I forget having loved you so?),
   In the sad half-light of evening,
   The face that was all my sunrising.
   So then at the ends of the earth I'll stand
   And hold you fiercely by either hand,
   And seeing your age and ashen hair
   I'll curse the thing that once you were,
   Because it is changed and pale and old
   (Lips that were scarlet, hair that was gold!),
   And I loved you before you were old and wise,
   When the flame of youth was strong in your eyes,
   -- And my heart is sick with memories.

   Oh! Death will find me, long before I tire
    Of watching you; and swing me suddenly
   Into the shade and loneliness and mire
    Of the last land!  There, waiting patiently,

   One day, I think, I'll feel a cool wind blowing,
    See a slow light across the Stygian tide,
   And hear the Dead about me stir, unknowing,
    And tremble.  And I shall know that you have died,

   And watch you, a broad-browed and smiling dream,
    Pass, light as ever, through the lightless host,
   Quietly ponder, start, and sway, and gleam --
    Most individual and bewildering ghost! --

   And turn, and toss your brown delightful head
   Amusedly, among the ancient Dead.

   I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.
    Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.
   On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --
    The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.
   Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.
    Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.
   But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,
    Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell
   Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:
    An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,
   Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;
    For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness.
   Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain.  They doubt, and sigh,
    And do not love at all.  Of these am I.

   I think if you had loved me when I wanted;
    If I'd looked up one day, and seen your eyes,
   And found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted,
    And your brown face, that's full of pity and wise,
   Flushed suddenly; the white godhead in new fear
    Intolerably so struggling, and so shamed;
   Most holy and far, if you'd come all too near,
    If earth had seen Earth's lordliest wild limbs tamed,
   Shaken, and trapped, and shivering, for MY touch --
    Myself should I have slain? or that foul you?
   But this the strange gods, who had given so much,
    To have seen and known you, this they might not do.
   One last shame's spared me, one black word's unspoken;
    And I'm alone; and you have not awoken.

   When the white flame in us is gone,
    And we that lost the world's delight
   Stiffen in darkness, left alone
    To crumble in our separate night;

   When your swift hair is quiet in death,
    And through the lips corruption thrust
   Has stilled the labour of my breath --
    When we are dust, when we are dust! --

   Not dead, not undesirous yet,
    Still sentient, still unsatisfied,
   We'll ride the air, and shine, and flit,
    Around the places where we died,

   And dance as dust before the sun,
    And light of foot, and unconfined,
   Hurry from road to road, and run
    About the errands of the wind.

   And every mote, on earth or air,
    Will speed and gleam, down later days,
   And like a secret pilgrim fare
    By eager and invisible ways,

   Nor ever rest, nor ever lie,
    Till, beyond thinking, out of view,
   One mote of all the dust that's I
    Shall meet one atom that was you.

   Then in some garden hushed from wind,
    Warm in a sunset's afterglow,
   The lovers in the flowers will find
    A sweet and strange unquiet grow

   Upon the peace; and, past desiring,
    So high a beauty in the air,
   And such a light, and such a quiring,
    And such a radiant ecstasy there,

   They'll know not if it's fire, or dew,
    Or out of earth, or in the height,
   Singing, or flame, or scent, or hue,
    Or two that pass, in light, to light,

   Out of the garden, higher, higher. . . .
    But in that instant they shall learn
   The shattering ecstasy of our fire,
    And the weak passionless hearts will burn

   And faint in that amazing glow,
    Until the darkness close above;
   And they will know -- poor fools, they'll know! --
    One moment, what it is to love.

   When love has changed to kindliness --
   Oh, love, our hungry lips, that press
   So tight that Time's an old god's dream
   Nodding in heaven, and whisper stuff
   Seven million years were not enough
   To think on after, make it seem
   Less than the breath of children playing,
   A blasphemy scarce worth the saying,
   A sorry jest, "When love has grown
   To kindliness -- to kindliness!" . . .
   And yet -- the best that either's known
   Will change, and wither, and be less,
   At last, than comfort, or its own
   Remembrance.  And when some caress
   Tendered in habit (once a flame
   All heaven sang out to) wakes the shame
   Unworded, in the steady eyes
   We'll have, -- THAT day, what shall we do?
   Being so noble, kill the two
   Who've reached their second-best?  Being wise,
   Break cleanly off, and get away.
   Follow down other windier skies
   New lures, alone?  Or shall we stay,
   Since this is all we've known, content
   In the lean twilight of such day,
   And not remember, not lament?
   That time when all is over, and
   Hand never flinches, brushing hand;
   And blood lies quiet, for all you're near;
   And it's but spoken words we hear,
   Where trumpets sang; when the mere skies
   Are stranger and nobler than your eyes;
   And flesh is flesh, was flame before;
   And infinite hungers leap no more
   In the chance swaying of your dress;
   And love has changed to kindliness.

   As those of old drank mummia
    To fire their limbs of lead,
   Making dead kings from Africa
    Stand pandar to their bed;

   Drunk on the dead, and medicined
    With spiced imperial dust,
   In a short night they reeled to find
    Ten centuries of lust.

   So I, from paint, stone, tale, and rhyme,
    Stuffed love's infinity,
   And sucked all lovers of all time
    To rarify ecstasy.

   Helen's the hair shuts out from me
    Verona's livid skies;
   Gypsy the lips I press; and see
    Two Antonys in your eyes.

   The unheard invisible lovely dead
    Lie with us in this place,
   And ghostly hands above my head
    Close face to straining face;

   Their blood is wine along our limbs;
    Their whispering voices wreathe
   Savage forgotten drowsy hymns
    Under the names we breathe;

   Woven from their tomb, and one with it,
    The night wherein we press;
   Their thousand pitchy pyres have lit
    Your flaming nakedness.

   For the uttermost years have cried and clung
    To kiss your mouth to mine;
   And hair long dust was caught, was flung,
    Hand shaken to hand divine,

   And Life has fired, and Death not shaded,
    All Time's uncounted bliss,
   And the height o' the world has flamed and faded,
    Love, that our love be this!

   In a cool curving world he lies
   And ripples with dark ecstasies.
   The kind luxurious lapse and steal
   Shapes all his universe to feel
   And know and be; the clinging stream
   Closes his memory, glooms his dream,
   Who lips the roots o' the shore, and glides
   Superb on unreturning tides.
   Those silent waters weave for him
   A fluctuant mutable world and dim,
   Where wavering masses bulge and gape
   Mysterious, and shape to shape
   Dies momently through whorl and hollow,
   And form and line and solid follow
   Solid and line and form to dream
   Fantastic down the eternal stream;
   An obscure world, a shifting world,
   Bulbous, or pulled to thin, or curled,
   Or serpentine, or driving arrows,
   Or serene slidings, or March narrows.
   There slipping wave and shore are one,
   And weed and mud.  No ray of sun,
   But glow to glow fades down the deep
   (As dream to unknown dream in sleep);
   Shaken translucency illumes
   The hyaline of drifting glooms;
   The strange soft-handed depth subdues
   Drowned colour there, but black to hues,
   As death to living, decomposes --
   Red darkness of the heart of roses,
   Blue brilliant from dead starless skies,
   And gold that lies behind the eyes,
   The unknown unnameable sightless white
   That is the essential flame of night,
   Lustreless purple, hooded green,
   The myriad hues that lie between
   Darkness and darkness! . . .

                                 And all's one.
   Gentle, embracing, quiet, dun,
   The world he rests in, world he knows,
   Perpetual curving.  Only -- grows
   An eddy in that ordered falling,
   A knowledge from the gloom, a calling
   Weed in the wave, gleam in the mud --
   The dark fire leaps along his blood;
   Dateless and deathless, blind and still,
   The intricate impulse works its will;
   His woven world drops back; and he,
   Sans providence, sans memory,
   Unconscious and directly driven,
   Fades to some dank sufficient heaven.

   O world of lips, O world of laughter,
   Where hope is fleet and thought flies after,
   Of lights in the clear night, of cries
   That drift along the wave and rise
   Thin to the glittering stars above,
   You know the hands, the eyes of love!
   The strife of limbs, the sightless clinging,
   The infinite distance, and the singing
   Blown by the wind, a flame of sound,
   The gleam, the flowers, and vast around
   The horizon, and the heights above --
   You know the sigh, the song of love!

   But there the night is close, and there
   Darkness is cold and strange and bare;
   And the secret deeps are whisperless;
   And rhythm is all deliciousness;
   And joy is in the throbbing tide,
   Whose intricate fingers beat and glide
   In felt bewildering harmonies
   Of trembling touch; and music is
   The exquisite knocking of the blood.
   Space is no more, under the mud;
   His bliss is older than the sun.
   Silent and straight the waters run.
   The lights, the cries, the willows dim,
   And the dark tide are one with him.

   How can we find? how can we rest? how can
   We, being gods, win joy, or peace, being man?
   We, the gaunt zanies of a witless Fate,
   Who love the unloving and lover hate,
   Forget the moment ere the moment slips,
   Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips,
   Who want, and know not what we want, and cry
   With crooked mouths for Heaven, and throw it by.
   Love's for completeness!  No perfection grows
   'Twixt leg, and arm, elbow, and ear, and nose,
   And joint, and socket; but unsatisfied
   Sprawling desires, shapeless, perverse, denied.
   Finger with finger wreathes; we love, and gape,
   Fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape,
   Straggling, irregular, perplexed, embossed,
   Grotesquely twined, extravagantly lost
   By crescive paths and strange protuberant ways
   From sanity and from wholeness and from grace.
   How can love triumph, how can solace be,
   Where fever turns toward fever, knee toward knee?
   Could we but fill to harmony, and dwell
   Simple as our thought and as perfectible,
   Rise disentangled from humanity
   Strange whole and new into simplicity,
   Grow to a radiant round love, and bear
   Unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere,
   Love moon to moon unquestioning, and be
   Like the star Lunisequa, steadfastly
   Following the round clear orb of her delight,
   Patiently ever, through the eternal night!

   Voices out of the shade that cried,
    And long noon in the hot calm places,
   And children's play by the wayside,
    And country eyes, and quiet faces --
    All these were round my steady paces.

   Those that I could have loved went by me;
    Cool gardened homes slept in the sun;
   I heard the whisper of water nigh me,
    Saw hands that beckoned, shone, were gone
    In the green and gold.  And I went on.

   For if my echoing footfall slept,
    Soon a far whispering there'd be
   Of a little lonely wind that crept
    From tree to tree, and distantly
    Followed me, followed me. . . .

   But the blue vaporous end of day
    Brought peace, and pursuit baffled quite,
   Where between pine-woods dipped the way.
    I turned, slipped in and out of sight.
    I trod as quiet as the night.

   The pine-boles kept perpetual hush;
    And in the boughs wind never swirled.
   I found a flowering lowly bush,
    And bowed, slid in, and sighed and curled,
    Hidden at rest from all the world.

   Safe!  I was safe, and glad, I knew!
    Yet -- with cold heart and cold wet brows
   I lay.  And the dark fell. . . .  There grew
    Meward a sound of shaken boughs;
    And ceased, above my intricate house;

   And silence, silence, silence found me. . . .
    I felt the unfaltering movement creep
   Among the leaves.  They shed around me
    Calm clouds of scent, that I did weep;
    And stroked my face.  I fell asleep

   Breathless, we flung us on the windy hill,
    Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.
    You said, "Through glory and ecstasy we pass;
   Wind, sun, and earth remain, the birds sing still,
   When we are old, are old. . . ."  "And when we die
    All's over that is ours; and life burns on
   Through other lovers, other lips," said I,
   -- "Heart of my heart, our heaven is now, is won!"

   "We are Earth's best, that learnt her lesson here.
    Life is our cry.  We have kept the faith!" we said;
    "We shall go down with unreluctant tread
   Rose-crowned into the darkness!" . . .  Proud we were,
   And laughed, that had such brave true things to say.
   -- And then you suddenly cried, and turned away.

   I dreamt I was in love again
    With the One Before the Last,
   And smiled to greet the pleasant pain
    Of that innocent young past.

   But I jumped to feel how sharp had been
    The pain when it did live,
   How the faded dreams of Nineteen-ten
    Were Hell in Nineteen-five.

   The boy's woe was as keen and clear,
    The boy's love just as true,
   And the One Before the Last, my dear,
    Hurt quite as much as you.

   Sickly I pondered how the lover
    Wrongs the unanswering tomb,
   And sentimentalizes over
    What earned a better doom.

   Gently he tombs the poor dim last time,
    Strews pinkish dust above,
   And sighs, "The dear dead boyish pastime!
    But THIS -- ah, God! -- is Love!"

   -- Better oblivion hide dead true loves,
    Better the night enfold,
   Than men, to eke the praise of new loves,
    Should lie about the old!

   Oh! bitter thoughts I had in plenty.
    But here's the worst of it --
   I shall forget, in Nineteen-twenty,
    YOU ever hurt abit!

   The stars, a jolly company,
    I envied, straying late and lonely;
   And cried upon their revelry:
    "O white companionship!  You only
   In love, in faith unbroken dwell,
   Friends radiant and inseparable!"

   Light-heart and glad they seemed to me
    And merry comrades (EVEN SO
   GOD OUT OF HEAVEN MAY LAUGH TO SEE
    THE HAPPY CROWDS; AND NEVER KNOW
   THAT IN HIS LONE OBSCURE DISTRESS
   EACH WALKETH IN A WILDERNESS).

   But I, remembering, pitied well
    And loved them, who, with lonely light,
   In empty infinite spaces dwell,
    Disconsolate.  For, all the night,
   I heard the thin gnat-voices cry,
   Star to faint star, across the sky.

   He wakes, who never thought to wake again,
    Who held the end was Death.  He opens eyes
   Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain
    Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens.  He lies;
    And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise
   Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,
   Like a dry branch.  No life is in that land,
    Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries;
   An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck
    Of moveless horror; an Immortal One
   Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly
    Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse's neck.

   I thought when love for you died, I should die.
   It's dead.  Alone, most strangely, I live on.

   Swings the way still by hollow and hill,
    And all the world's a song;
   "She's far," it sings me, "but fair," it rings me,
    "Quiet," it laughs, "and strong!"

   Oh! spite of the miles and years between us,
    Spite of your chosen part,
   I do remember; and I go
    With laughter in my heart.

   So above the little folk that know not,
    Out of the white hill-town,
   High up I clamber; and I remember;
    And watch the day go down.

   Gold is my heart, and the world's golden,
    And one peak tipped with light;
   And the air lies still about the hill
    With the first fear of night;

   Till mystery down the soundless valley
    Thunders, and dark is here;
   And the wind blows, and the light goes,
    And the night is full of fear,

   And I know, one night, on some far height,
    In the tongue I never knew,
   I yet shall hear the tidings clear
    From them that were friends of you.

   They'll call the news from hill to hill,
    Dark and uncomforted,
   Earth and sky and the winds; and I
    Shall know that you are dead.

   I shall not hear your trentals,
    Nor eat your arval bread;
   For the kin of you will surely do
    Their duty by the dead.

   Their little dull greasy eyes will water;
    They'll paw you, and gulp afresh.
   They'll sniffle and weep, and their thoughts will creep
    Like flies on the cold flesh.

   They will put pence on your grey eyes,
    Bind up your fallen chin,
   And lay you straight, the fools that loved you
    Because they were your kin.

   They will praise all the bad about you,
    And hush the good away,
   And wonder how they'll do without you,
    And then they'll go away.

   But quieter than one sleeping,
    And stranger than of old,
   You will not stir for weeping,
    You will not mind the cold;

   But through the night the lips will laugh not,
    The hands will be in place,
   And at length the hair be lying still
    About the quiet face.

   With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,
    And dim and decorous mirth,
   With ham and sherry, they'll meet to bury
    The lordliest lass of earth.

   The little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving
    Behind lone-riding you,
   The heart so high, the heart so living,
    Heart that they never knew.

   I shall not hear your trentals,
    Nor eat your arval bread,
   Nor with smug breath tell lies of death
    To the unanswering dead.

   With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,
    The folk who loved you not
   Will bury you, and go wondering
    Back home.  And you will rot.

   But laughing and half-way up to heaven,
    With wind and hill and star,
   I yet shall keep, before I sleep,
    Your Ambarvalia.

   There was a damned successful Poet;
    There was a Woman like the Sun.
   And they were dead.  They did not know it.
    They did not know their time was done.
       They did not know his hymns
       Were silence; and her limbs,
       That had served Love so well,
       Dust, and a filthy smell.

   And so one day, as ever of old,
    Hands out, they hurried, knee to knee;
   On fire to cling and kiss and hold
    And, in the other's eyes, to see
       Each his own tiny face,
       And in that long embrace
       Feel lip and breast grow warm
       To breast and lip and arm.

   So knee to knee they sped again,
    And laugh to laugh they ran, I'm told,
   Across the streets of Hell . . .
                                     And then
    They suddenly felt the wind blow cold,
       And knew, so closely pressed,
       Chill air on lip and breast,
       And, with a sick surprise,
       The emptiness of eyes.

   Here, where love's stuff is body, arm and side
    Are stabbing-sweet 'gainst chair and lamp and wall.
   In every touch more intimate meanings hide;
    And flaming brains are the white heart of all.

   Here, million pulses to one centre beat:
    Closed in by men's vast friendliness, alone,
   Two can be drunk with solitude, and meet
    On the sheer point where sense with knowing's one.

   Here the green-purple clanging royal night,
    And the straight lines and silent walls of town,
   And roar, and glare, and dust, and myriad white
    Undying passers, pinnacle and crown

   Intensest heavens between close-lying faces
    By the lamp's airless fierce ecstatic fire;
   And we've found love in little hidden places,
    Under great shades, between the mist and mire.

   Stay! though the woods are quiet, and you've heard
    Night creep along the hedges.  Never go
   Where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird,
    And the remote winds sigh, and waters flow!

   Lest -- as our words fall dumb on windless noons,
    Or hearts grow hushed and solitary, beneath
   Unheeding stars and unfamiliar moons,
    Or boughs bend over, close and quiet as death, --

   Unconscious and unpassionate and still,
    Cloud-like we lean and stare as bright leaves stare,
   And gradually along the stranger hill
    Our unwalled loves thin out on vacuous air,

   And suddenly there's no meaning in our kiss,
    And your lit upward face grows, where we lie,
   Lonelier and dreadfuller than sunlight is,
    And dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky.

   For moveless limbs no pity I crave,
    That never were swift!  Still all I prize,
   Laughter and thought and friends, I have;
    No fool to heave luxurious sighs
   For the woods and hills that I never knew.
   The more excellent way's yet mine!  And you

   Flower-laden come to the clean white cell,
    And we talk as ever -- am I not the same?
   With our hearts we love, immutable,
    You without pity, I without shame.
   We talk as of old; as of old you go
   Out under the sky, and laughing, I know,

   Flit through the streets, your heart all me;
    Till you gain the world beyond the town.
   Then -- I fade from your heart, quietly;
    And your fleet steps quicken.  The strong down
   Smiles you welcome there; the woods that love you
   Close lovely and conquering arms above you.

   O ever-moving, O lithe and free!
    Fast in my linen prison I press
   On impassable bars, or emptily
    Laugh in my great loneliness.
   And still in the white neat bed I strive
   Most impotently against that gyve;
   Being less now than a thought, even,
   To you alone with your hills and heaven.

   Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke
    To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate
    On that adulterous whore a ten years' hate
   And a king's honour.  Through red death, and smoke,
   And cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,
    Till the still innermost chamber fronted him.
    He swung his sword, and crashed into the dim
   Luxurious bower, flaming like a god.

   High sat white Helen, lonely and serene.
    He had not remembered that she was so fair,
   And that her neck curved down in such a way;
   And he felt tired.  He flung the sword away,
    And kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,
   The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.

   So far the poet.  How should he behold
    That journey home, the long connubial years?
    He does not tell you how white Helen bears
   Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,
   Haggard with virtue.  Menelaus bold
    Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys
    'Twixt noon and supper.  And her golden voice
   Got shrill as he grew deafer.  And both were old.

   Often he wonders why on earth he went
    Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came.
   Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;
    Her dry shanks twitch at Paris' mumbled name.
   So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;
   And Paris slept on by Scamander side.

   How should I know?  The enormous wheels of will
    Drove me cold-eyed on tired and sleepless feet.
   Night was void arms and you a phantom still,
    And day your far light swaying down the street.
   As never fool for love, I starved for you;
    My throat was dry and my eyes hot to see.
   Your mouth so lying was most heaven in view,
    And your remembered smell most agony.

   Love wakens love!  I felt your hot wrist shiver
    And suddenly the mad victory I planned
     Flashed real, in your burning bending head. . . .
   My conqueror's blood was cool as a deep river
    In shadow; and my heart beneath your hand
     Quieter than a dead man on a bed.

   When I see you, who were so wise and cool,
   Gazing with silly sickness on that fool
   You've given your love to, your adoring hands
   Touch his so intimately that each understands,
   I know, most hidden things; and when I know
   Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow
   Of his red lips, and that the empty grace
   Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face,
   Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love,
   That you have given him every touch and move,
   Wrinkle and secret of you, all your life,
   -- Oh! then I know I'm waiting, lover-wife,
   For the great time when love is at a close,
   And all its fruit's to watch the thickening nose
   And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye,
   That are yours, and you, most surely, till you die!
   Day after day you'll sit with him and note
   The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat;
   As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat,
   And love, love, love to habit!
                                   And after that,
   When all that's fine in man is at an end,
   And you, that loved young life and clean, must tend
   A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old,
   When his rare lips hang flabby and can't hold
   Slobber, and you're enduring that worst thing,
   Senility's queasy furtive love-making,
   And searching those dear eyes for human meaning,
   Propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning
   A scrap that life's flung by, and love's forgotten, --
   Then you'll be tired; and passion dead and rotten;
   And he'll be dirty, dirty!

   My restless blood now lies a-quiver,
    Knowing that always, exquisitely,
   This April twilight on the river
    Stirs anguish in the heart of me.

   For the fast world in that rare glimmer
    Puts on the witchery of a dream,
   The straight grey buildings, richly dimmer,
    The fiery windows, and the stream

   With willows leaning quietly over,
    The still ecstatic fading skies . . .
   And all these, like a waiting lover,
    Murmur and gleam, lift lustrous eyes,

   Drift close to me, and sideways bending
    Whisper delicious words.
                              But I
   Stretch terrible hands, uncomprehending,
    Shaken with love; and laugh; and cry.

   My agony made the willows quiver;
    I heard the knocking of my heart
   Die loudly down the windless river,
    I heard the pale skies fall apart,

   And the shrill stars' unmeaning laughter,
    And my voice with the vocal trees
   Weeping.  And Hatred followed after,
    Shrilling madly down the breeze.

   In peace from the wild heart of clamour,
    A flower in moonlight, she was there,
   Was rippling down white ways of glamour
    Quietly laid on wave and air.

   Her passing left no leaf a-quiver.
    Pale flowers wreathed her white, white brows.
   Her feet were silence on the river;
    And "Hush!" she said, between the boughs.

   In darkness the loud sea makes moan;
   And earth is shaken, and all evils creep
   About her ways.
                    Oh, now to know you sleep!
   Out of the whirling blinding moil, alone,
   Out of the slow grim fight,
   One thought to wing -- to you, asleep,
   In some cool room that's open to the night
   Lying half-forward, breathing quietly,
   One white hand on the white
   Unrumpled sheet, and the ever-moving hair
   Quiet and still at length! . . .

   Your magic and your beauty and your strength,
   Like hills at noon or sunlight on a tree,
   Sleeping prevail in earth and air.

   In the sweet gloom above the brown and white
   Night benedictions hover; and the winds of night
   Move gently round the room, and watch you there.
   And through the dreadful hours
   The trees and waters and the hills have kept
   The sacred vigil while you slept,
   And lay a way of dew and flowers
   Where your feet, your morning feet, shall tread.
   And still the darkness ebbs about your bed.
   Quiet, and strange, and loving-kind, you sleep.
   And holy joy about the earth is shed;
   And holiness upon the deep.

   From the candles and dumb shadows,
    And the house where love had died,
   I stole to the vast moonlight
    And the whispering life outside.
   But I found no lips of comfort,
    No home in the moon's light
   (I, little and lone and frightened
    In the unfriendly night),
   And no meaning in the voices. . . .
    Far over the lands and through
   The dark, beyond the ocean,
    I willed to think of YOU!
   For I knew, had you been with me
    I'd have known the words of night,
   Found peace of heart, gone gladly
    In comfort of that light.

   Oh! the wind with soft beguiling
    Would have stolen my thought away;
   And the night, subtly smiling,
    Came by the silver way;
   And the moon came down and danced to me,
    And her robe was white and flying;
   And trees bent their heads to me
    Mysteriously crying;
   And dead voices wept around me;
    And dead soft fingers thrilled;
   And the little gods whispered. . . .
                                         But ever
    Desperately I willed;
   Till all grew soft and far
    And silent . . .
                      And suddenly
   I found you white and radiant,
    Sleeping quietly,
   Far out through the tides of darkness.
    And I there in that great light
   Was alone no more, nor fearful;
    For there, in the homely night,
   Was no thought else that mattered,
    And nothing else was true,
   But the white fire of moonlight,
    And a white dream of you.

   "Oh! Love," they said, "is King of Kings,
    And Triumph is his crown.
   Earth fades in flame before his wings,
    And Sun and Moon bow down." --
   But that, I knew, would never do;
    And Heaven is all too high.
   So whenever I meet a Queen, I said,
    I will not catch her eye.

   "Oh! Love," they said, and "Love," they said,
    "The gift of Love is this;
   A crown of thorns about thy head,
    And vinegar to thy kiss!" --
   But Tragedy is not for me;
    And I'm content to be gay.
   So whenever I spied a Tragic Lady,
    I went another way.

   And so I never feared to see
    You wander down the street,
   Or come across the fields to me
    On ordinary feet.
   For what they'd never told me of,
    And what I never knew;
   It was that all the time, my love,
    Love would be merely you.

   Safe in the magic of my woods
    I lay, and watched the dying light.
   Faint in the pale high solitudes,
    And washed with rain and veiled by night,

   Silver and blue and green were showing.
    And the dark woods grew darker still;
   And birds were hushed; and peace was growing;
    And quietness crept up the hill;

    And no wind was blowing

   And I knew
   That this was the hour of knowing,
   And the night and the woods and you
   Were one together, and I should find
   Soon in the silence the hidden key
   Of all that had hurt and puzzled me --
   Why you were you, and the night was kind,
   And the woods were part of the heart of me.

   And there I waited breathlessly,
   Alone; and slowly the holy three,
   The three that I loved, together grew
   One, in the hour of knowing,
   Night, and the woods, and you ----

   And suddenly
   There was an uproar in my woods,

   The noise of a fool in mock distress,
   Crashing and laughing and blindly going,
   Of ignorant feet and a swishing dress,
   And a Voice profaning the solitudes.

   The spell was broken, the key denied me
   And at length your flat clear voice beside me
   Mouthed cheerful clear flat platitudes.

   You came and quacked beside me in the wood.
   You said, "The view from here is very good!"
   You said, "It's nice to be alone a bit!"
   And, "How the days are drawing out!" you said.
   You said, "The sunset's pretty, isn't it?"

   By God! I wish -- I wish that you were dead
   When you were there, and you, and you,
   Happiness crowned the night; I too,
   Laughing and looking, one of all,
   I watched the quivering lamplight fall
   On plate and flowers and pouring tea
   And cup and cloth; and they and we
   Flung all the dancing moments by
   With jest and glitter.  Lip and eye
   Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,
   Improvident, unmemoried;
   And fitfully and like a flame
   The light of laughter went and came.
   Proud in their careless transience moved
   The changing faces that I loved.

   Till suddenly, and otherwhence,
   I looked upon your innocence.
   For lifted clear and still and strange
   From the dark woven flow of change
   Under a vast and starless sky
   I saw the immortal moment lie.
   One instant I, an instant, knew
   As God knows all.  And it and you
   I, above Time, oh, blind! could see
   In witless immortality.
   I saw the marble cup; the tea,
   Hung on the air, an amber stream;
   I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,
   The painted flame, the frozen smoke.
   No more the flooding lamplight broke
   On flying eyes and lips and hair;
   But lay, but slept unbroken there,
   On stiller flesh, and body breathless,
   And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,
   And words on which no silence grew.
   Light was more alive than you.

   For suddenly, and otherwhence,
   I looked on your magnificence.
   I saw the stillness and the light,
   And you, august, immortal, white,
   Holy and strange; and every glint
   Posture and jest and thought and tint
   Freed from the mask of transiency,
   Triumphant in eternity,
   Immote, immortal.

                      Dazed at length
   Human eyes grew, mortal strength
   Wearied; and Time began to creep.
   Change closed about me like a sleep.
   Light glinted on the eyes I loved.
   The cup was filled.  The bodies moved.
   The drifting petal came to ground.
   The laughter chimed its perfect round.
   The broken syllable was ended.
   And I, so certain and so friended,
   How could I cloud, or how distress,
   The heaven of your unconsciousness?
   Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,
   Stammering of lights unutterable?
   The eternal holiness of you,
   The timeless end, you never knew,
   The peace that lay, the light that shone.
   You never knew that I had gone
   A million miles away, and stayed
   A million years.  The laughter played
   Unbroken round me; and the jest
   Flashed on.  And we that knew the best
   Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.
   I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,
   And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,
   When you were there, and you, and you.

   In a flowered dell the Lady Venus stood,
    Amazed with sorrow.  Down the morning one
    Far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun
   Rang out; and held; and died. . . .  She thought the wood
   Grew quieter.  Wing, and leaf, and pool of light
    Forgot to dance.  Dumb lay the unfalling stream;
    Life one eternal instant rose in dream
   Clear out of time, poised on a golden height. . . .

   Till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour.
   The gold waves purled amidst the green above her;
    And a bird sang.  With one sharp-taken breath,
   By sunlit branches and unshaken flower,
   The immortal limbs flashed to the human lover,
    And the immortal eyes to look on death.

   The damned ship lurched and slithered.  Quiet and quick
    My cold gorge rose; the long sea rolled; I knew
   I must think hard of something, or be sick;
    And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!
   You, you alone could hold my fancy ever!
    And with you memories come, sharp pain, and dole.
   Now there's a choice -- heartache or tortured liver!
    A sea-sick body, or a you-sick soul!

   Do I forget you?  Retchings twist and tie me,
    Old meat, good meals, brown gobbets, up I throw.
   Do I remember?  Acrid return and slimy,
    The sobs and slobber of a last years woe.
   And still the sick ship rolls.  'Tis hard, I tell ye,
   To choose 'twixt love and nausea, heart and belly.
   All night the ways of Heaven were desolate,
    Long roads across a gleaming empty sky.
    Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,
   Alone, serene beyond all love or hate,
   Terror or triumph, were content to wait,
    We, silent and all-knowing.  Suddenly
    Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high,
   One horseman, downward to the earth's low gate.

   Oh, perfect from the ultimate height of living,
    Lightly we turned, through wet woods blossom-hung,
   Into the open.  Down the supernal roads,
    With plumes a-tossing, purple flags far flung,
   Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,
    Thundered the black battalions of the Gods.

   Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered throng;
    And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise,
   High-throned you sit, and gracious.  All day long
    Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester Fantasies,
    And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar Sighs,
   Bow to your benediction, go their way.
    And the grave jewelled courtier Memories
   Worship and love and tend you, all the day.

   But when I sleep, and all my thoughts go straying,
    When the high session of the day is ended,
   And darkness comes; then, with the waning light,
    By lilied maidens on your way attended,
   Proud from the wonted throne, superbly swaying,
    You, like a queen, pass out into the night.

   Ah! not now, when desire burns, and the wind calls, and the suns of spring
   Light-foot dance in the woods, whisper of life, woo me to wayfaring;
   Ah! not now should you come, now when the road beckons,
     and good friends call,
   Where are songs to be sung, fights to be fought, yea! and the best of all,
   Love, on myriad lips fairer than yours, kisses you could not give! . . .
   Dearest, why should I mourn, whimper, and whine, I that have yet to live?
   Sorrow will I forget, tears for the best, love on the lips of you,
   Now, when dawn in the blood wakes, and the sun laughs up the eastern blue;
   I'll forget and be glad!
                             Only at length, dear, when the great day ends,
   When love dies with the last light, and the last song has been sung,
     and friends
   All are perished, and gloom strides on the heaven:  then, as alone I lie,
   'Mid Death's gathering winds, frightened and dumb, sick for the past, may I
   Feel you suddenly there, cool at my brow; then may I hear the peace
   Of your voice at the last, whispering love, calling, ere all can cease
   In the silence of death; then may I see dimly, and know, a space,
   Bending over me, last light in the dark, once, as of old, your face.

   Here the flame that was ash, shrine that was void,
     lost in the haunted wood,
   I have tended and loved, year upon year, I in the solitude
   Waiting, quiet and glad-eyed in the dark, knowing that once a gleam
   Glowed and went through the wood.  Still I abode strong in a golden dream,
   Unrecaptured.
                  For I, I that had faith, knew that a face would glance
   One day, white in the dim woods, and a voice call, and a radiance
   Fill the grove, and the fire suddenly leap . . . and, in the heart of it,
   End of labouring, you!  Therefore I kept ready the altar, lit
   The flame, burning apart.
                              Face of my dreams vainly in vision white
   Gleaming down to me, lo! hopeless I rise now.  For about midnight
   Whispers grew through the wood suddenly, strange cries in the boughs above
   Grated, cries like a laugh.  Silent and black then through the sacred grove
   Great birds flew, as a dream, troubling the leaves, passing at length.
                                                                        I knew
   Long expected and long loved, that afar, God of the dim wood, you
   Somewhere lay, as a child sleeping, a child suddenly reft from mirth,
   White and wonderful yet, white in your youth, stretched upon foreign earth,
   God, immortal and dead!
                            Therefore I go; never to rest, or win
   Peace, and worship of you more, and the dumb wood and the shrine therein.

   So light we were, so right we were, so fair faith shone,
   And the way was laid so certainly, that, when I'd gone,
   What dumb thing looked up at you?  Was it something heard,
   Or a sudden cry, that meekly and without a word
   You broke the faith, and strangely, weakly, slipped apart.
   You gave in -- you, the proud of heart, unbowed of heart!
   Was this, friend, the end of all that we could do?
   And have you found the best for you, the rest for you?
   Did you learn so suddenly (and I not by!)
   Some whispered story, that stole the glory from the sky,
   And ended all the splendid dream, and made you go
   So dully from the fight we know, the light we know?

   O faithless! the faith remains, and I must pass
   Gay down the way, and on alone.  Under the grass
   You wait; the breeze moves in the trees, and stirs, and calls,
   And covers you with white petals, with light petals.
   There it shall crumble, frail and fair, under the sun,
   O little heart, your brittle heart; till day be done,
   And the shadows gather, falling light, and, white with dew,
   Whisper, and weep; and creep to you.  Good sleep to you!

   Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,
    And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
   With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
    To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
   Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
    Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
   And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
    And all the little emptiness of love!

   Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
    Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
     Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
   Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
    But only agony, and that has ending;
     And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.

   Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest
    He who has found our hid security,
   Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,
    And heard our word, 'Who is so safe as we?'
   We have found safety with all things undying,
    The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,
   The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,
    And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.
   We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.
    We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.
   War knows no power.  Safe shall be my going,
    Secretly armed against all death's endeavour;
   Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;
   And if these poor limbs die, safest of all.
   Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!
    There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,
    But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.
   These laid the world away; poured out the red
   Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
    Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,
    That men call age; and those who would have been,
   Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

   Blow, bugles, blow!  They brought us, for our dearth,
    Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.
   Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,
    And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
   And Nobleness walks in our ways again;
    And we have come into our heritage.

   These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,
    Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.
   The years had given them kindness.  Dawn was theirs,
    And sunset, and the colours of the earth.
   These had seen movement, and heard music; known
    Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;
   Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;
    Touched flowers and furs and cheeks.  All this is ended.

   There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
   And lit by the rich skies, all day.  And after,
    Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance
   And wandering loveliness.  He leaves a white
    Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,
   A width, a shining peace, under the night.

   If I should die, think only this of me:
    That there's some corner of a foreign field
   That is for ever England.  There shall be
    In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
   A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
    Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
   A body of England's, breathing English air,
    Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

   And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
    A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
     Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
   Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
    And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
     In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.

   When colour goes home into the eyes,
    And lights that shine are shut again
   With dancing girls and sweet birds' cries
    Behind the gateways of the brain;
   And that no-place which gave them birth, shall close
   The rainbow and the rose: --

   Still may Time hold some golden space
    Where I'll unpack that scented store
   Of song and flower and sky and face,
    And count, and touch, and turn them o'er,
   Musing upon them; as a mother, who
   Has watched her children all the rich day through
   Sits, quiet-handed, in the fading light,
   When children sleep, ere night.

   Mamua, when our laughter ends,
   And hearts and bodies, brown as white,
   Are dust about the doors of friends,
   Or scent ablowing down the night,
   Then, oh! then, the wise agree,
   Comes our immortality.
   Mamua, there waits a land
   Hard for us to understand.
   Out of time, beyond the sun,
   All are one in Paradise,
   You and Pupure are one,
   And Tau, and the ungainly wise.
   There the Eternals are, and there
   The Good, the Lovely, and the True,
   And Types, whose earthly copies were
   The foolish broken things we knew;
   There is the Face, whose ghosts we are;
   The real, the never-setting Star;
   And the Flower, of which we love
   Faint and fading shadows here;
   Never a tear, but only Grief;
   Dance, but not the limbs that move;
   Songs in Song shall disappear;
   Instead of lovers, Love shall be;
   For hearts, Immutability;
   And there, on the Ideal Reef,
   Thunders the Everlasting Sea!

   And my laughter, and my pain,
   Shall home to the Eternal Brain.
   And all lovely things, they say,
   Meet in Loveliness again;
   Miri's laugh, Teipo's feet,
   And the hands of Matua,
   Stars and sunlight there shall meet,
   Coral's hues and rainbows there,
   And Teura's braided hair;
   And with the starred 'tiare's' white,
   And white birds in the dark ravine,
   And 'flamboyants' ablaze at night,
   And jewels, and evening's after-green,
   And dawns of pearl and gold and red,
   Mamua, your lovelier head!
   And there'll no more be one who dreams
   Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff,
   Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems,
   All time-entangled human love.
   And you'll no longer swing and sway
   Divinely down the scented shade,
   Where feet to Ambulation fade,
   And moons are lost in endless Day.
   How shall we wind these wreaths of ours,
   Where there are neither heads nor flowers?
   Oh, Heaven's Heaven! -- but we'll be missing
   The palms, and sunlight, and the south;
   And there's an end, I think, of kissing,
   When our mouths are one with Mouth. . . .

   'Tau here', Mamua,
   Crown the hair, and come away!
   Hear the calling of the moon,
   And the whispering scents that stray
   About the idle warm lagoon.
   Hasten, hand in human hand,
   Down the dark, the flowered way,
   Along the whiteness of the sand,
   And in the water's soft caress,
   Wash the mind of foolishness,
   Mamua, until the day.
   Spend the glittering moonlight there
   Pursuing down the soundless deep
   Limbs that gleam and shadowy hair,
   Or floating lazy, half-asleep.
   Dive and double and follow after,
   Snare in flowers, and kiss, and call,
   With lips that fade, and human laughter
   And faces individual,
   Well this side of Paradise! . . .
   There's little comfort in the wise.
   In your arms was still delight,
   Quiet as a street at night;
   And thoughts of you, I do remember,
   Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,
   Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.
   Love, in you, went passing by,
   Penetrative, remote, and rare,
   Like a bird in the wide air,
   And, as the bird, it left no trace
   In the heaven of your face.
   In your stupidity I found
   The sweet hush after a sweet sound.
   All about you was the light
   That dims the greying end of night;
   Desire was the unrisen sun,
   Joy the day not yet begun,
   With tree whispering to tree,
   Without wind, quietly.
   Wisdom slept within your hair,
   And Long-Suffering was there,
   And, in the flowing of your dress,
   Undiscerning Tenderness.
   And when you thought, it seemed to me,
   Infinitely, and like a sea,
   About the slight world you had known
   Your vast unconsciousness was thrown. . . .

   O haven without wave or tide!
   Silence, in which all songs have died!
   Holy book, where hearts are still!
   And home at length under the hill!
   O mother quiet, breasts of peace,
   Where love itself would faint and cease!
   O infinite deep I never knew,
   I would come back, come back to you,
   Find you, as a pool unstirred,
   Kneel down by you, and never a word,
   Lay my head, and nothing said,
   In your hands, ungarlanded;
   And a long watch you would keep;
   And I should sleep, and I should sleep!

   I have been so great a lover:  filled my days
   So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,
   The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,
   Desire illimitable, and still content,
   And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,
   For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
   Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
   Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife
   Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,
   My night shall be remembered for a star
   That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
   Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
   Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me
   High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see
   The inenarrable godhead of delight?
   Love is a flame; -- we have beaconed the world's night.
   A city: -- and we have built it, these and I.
   An emperor: -- we have taught the world to die.
   So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,
   And the high cause of Love's magnificence,
   And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names
   Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,
   And set them as a banner, that men may know,
   To dare the generations, burn, and blow
   Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming. . . .
   These I have loved:
                        White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
   Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
   Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust
   Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
   Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
   And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
   And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,
   Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
   Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon
   Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
   Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
   Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
   Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
   The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
   The good smell of old clothes; and other such --
   The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,
   Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers
   About dead leaves and last year's ferns. . . .
                                                   Dear names,
   And thousand other throng to me!  Royal flames;
   Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
   Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
   Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,
   Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
   Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
   That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
   And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold
   Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
   Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
   And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;
   And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass; --
   All these have been my loves.  And these shall pass,
   Whatever passes not, in the great hour,
   Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power
   To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
   They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,
   Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust
   And sacramented covenant to the dust.
   ---- Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,
   And give what's left of love again, and make
   New friends, now strangers. . . .
                                      But the best I've known,
   Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown
   About the winds of the world, and fades from brains
   Of living men, and dies.
                             Nothing remains.

   O dear my loves, O faithless, once again
   This one last gift I give:  that after men
   Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,
   Praise you, "All these were lovely"; say, "He loved."

   Fish (fly-replete, in depth of June,
   Dawdling away their wat'ry noon)
   Ponder deep wisdom, dark or clear,
   Each secret fishy hope or fear.
   Fish say, they have their Stream and Pond;
   But is there anything Beyond?
   This life cannot be All, they swear,
   For how unpleasant, if it were!
   One may not doubt that, somehow, Good
   Shall come of Water and of Mud;
   And, sure, the reverent eye must see
   A Purpose in Liquidity.
   We darkly know, by Faith we cry,
   The future is not Wholly Dry.
   Mud unto mud! -- Death eddies near --
   Not here the appointed End, not here!
   But somewhere, beyond Space and Time.
   Is wetter water, slimier slime!
   And there (they trust) there swimmeth One
   Who swam ere rivers were begun,
   Immense, of fishy form and mind,
   Squamous, omnipotent, and kind;
   And under that Almighty Fin,
   The littlest fish may enter in.
   Oh! never fly conceals a hook,
   Fish say, in the Eternal Brook,
   But more than mundane weeds are there,
   And mud, celestially fair;
   Fat caterpillars drift around,
   And Paradisal grubs are found;
   Unfading moths, immortal flies,
   And the worm that never dies.
   And in that Heaven of all their wish,
   There shall be no more land, say fish.

   When she sleeps, her soul, I know,
   Goes a wanderer on the air,
   Wings where I may never go,
   Leaves her lying, still and fair,
   Waiting, empty, laid aside,
   Like a dress upon a chair. . . .
   This I know, and yet I know
   Doubts that will not be denied.

   For if the soul be not in place,
   What has laid trouble in her face?
   And, sits there nothing ware and wise
   Behind the curtains of her eyes,
   What is it, in the self's eclipse,
   Shadows, soft and passingly,
   About the corners of her lips,
   The smile that is essential she?

   And if the spirit be not there,
   Why is fragrance in the hair?


   "Oh love is fair, and love is rare;" my dear one she said,
   "But love goes lightly over."  I bowed her foolish head,
   And kissed her hair and laughed at her.  Such a child was she;
   So new to love, so true to love, and she spoke so bitterly.

   But there's wisdom in women, of more than they have known,
   And thoughts go blowing through them, are wiser than their own,
   Or how should my dear one, being ignorant and young,
   Have cried on love so bitterly, with so true a tongue?

   He Wonders Whether to Praise or to Blame Her
   I have peace to weigh your worth, now all is over,
    But if to praise or blame you, cannot say.
   For, who decries the loved, decries the lover;
    Yet what man lauds the thing he's thrown away?

   Be you, in truth, this dull, slight, cloudy naught,
    The more fool I, so great a fool to adore;
   But if you're that high goddess once I thought,
    The more your godhead is, I lose the more.

   Dear fool, pity the fool who thought you clever!
    Dear wisdom, do not mock the fool that missed you!
   Most fair, -- the blind has lost your face for ever!
    Most foul, -- how could I see you while I kissed you?

   So . . . the poor love of fools and blind I've proved you,
   For, foul or lovely, 'twas a fool that loved you.

   Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
    Softly along the dim way to your room,
    And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
   And holiness about you as you slept.
   I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
    About my head, and held it.  I had rest
    Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
   I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

   It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
   Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
   And sleepy mother-comfort!
                               Child, you know
   How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
   Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
   Takes all too long to lay asleep again.

   Today I have been happy.  All the day
    I held the memory of you, and wove
   Its laughter with the dancing light o' the spray,
    And sowed the sky with tiny clouds of love,
   And sent you following the white waves of sea,
    And crowned your head with fancies, nothing worth,
   Stray buds from that old dust of misery,
    Being glad with a new foolish quiet mirth.

   So lightly I played with those dark memories,
   Just as a child, beneath the summer skies,
    Plays hour by hour with a strange shining stone,
   For which (he knows not) towns were fire of old,
    And love has been betrayed, and murder done,
   And great kings turned to a little bitter mould.

   Warm perfumes like a breath from vine and tree
    Drift down the darkness.  Plangent, hidden from eyes
    Somewhere an 'eukaleli' thrills and cries
   And stabs with pain the night's brown savagery.
   And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me,
    Gleam like a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise;
    And new stars burn into the ancient skies,
   Over the murmurous soft Hawaian sea.

   And I recall, lose, grasp, forget again,
    And still remember, a tale I have heard, or known,
   An empty tale, of idleness and pain,
    Of two that loved -- or did not love -- and one
   Whose perplexed heart did evil, foolishly,
   A long while since, and by some other sea.

   In the grey tumult of these after years
    Oft silence falls; the incessant wranglers part;
   And less-than-echoes of remembered tears
    Hush all the loud confusion of the heart;
   And a shade, through the toss'd ranks of mirth and crying
    Hungers, and pains, and each dull passionate mood, --
   Quite lost, and all but all forgot, undying,
    Comes back the ecstasy of your quietude.

   So a poor ghost, beside his misty streams,
   Is haunted by strange doubts, evasive dreams,
    Hints of a pre-Lethean life, of men,
   Stars, rocks, and flesh, things unintelligible,
    And light on waving grass, he knows not when,
   And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell.

   Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun,
    We'll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread
    Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead
   Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run
   Down some close-covered by-way of the air,
    Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,
    Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find
   Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there

   Spend in pure converse our eternal day;
    Think each in each, immediately wise;
   Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say
    What this tumultuous body now denies;
   And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;
    And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.

   Down the blue night the unending columns press
    In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,
    Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow
   Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.
   Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,
    And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,
    As who would pray good for the world, but know
   Their benediction empty as they bless.

   They say that the Dead die not, but remain
    Near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.
       I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,
   In wise majestic melancholy train,
       And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,
    And men, coming and going on the earth.

   They say there's a high windless world and strange,
    Out of the wash of days and temporal tide,
    Where Faith and Good, Wisdom and Truth abide,
   'Aeterna corpora', subject to no change.
   There the sure suns of these pale shadows move;
    There stand the immortal ensigns of our war;
    Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there, a star,
   And perishing hearts, imperishable Love. . . .

   Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss, smile;
    Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;
    Love has no habitation but the heart.
   Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch awhile,
    Cling, and are borne into the night apart.
    The laugh dies with the lips, 'Love' with the lover.

   Now that we've done our best and worst, and parted,
    I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend.
   (O heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted)
    I'll think of Love in books, Love without end;
   Women with child, content; and old men sleeping;
    And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain grain;
   And babes that weep, and so forget their weeping;
    And the young heavens, forgetful after rain;
   And evening hush, broken by homing wings;
    And Song's nobility, and Wisdom holy,
   That live, we dead.  I would think of a thousand things,
    Lovely and durable, and taste them slowly,
   One after one, like tasting a sweet food.
   I have need to busy my heart with quietude.

   Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,
    Where that comes in that shall not go again;
   Love sells the proud heart's citadel to Fate.
    They have known shame, who love unloved.  Even then,
   When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,
    And agony's forgot, and hushed the crying
   Of credulous hearts, in heaven -- such are but taking
    Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying
   Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost.
    Some share that night.  But they know love grows colder,
   Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most.
    Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder,
   But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss.
   All this is love; and all love is but this.

   Heart, you are restless as a paper scrap
    That's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind;
    Saying, "She is most wise, patient and kind.
   Between the small hands folded in her lap
   Surely a shamed head may bow down at length,
    And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
   About her lips, and wisdom in her strength,
    Peace in her peace.  Come to her, come to her!" . . .

   She will not care.  She'll smile to see me come,
    So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me.
    She'll give me all I ask, kiss me and hold me,
       And open wide upon that holy air
   The gates of peace, and take my tiredness home,
       Kinder than God.  But, heart, she will not care.

   Your hands, my dear, adorable,
    Your lips of tenderness
   -- Oh, I've loved you faithfully and well,
    Three years, or a bit less.
    It wasn't a success.

   Thank God, that's done! and I'll take the road,
    Quit of my youth and you,
   The Roman road to Wendover
    By Tring and Lilley Hoo,
    As a free man may do.

   For youth goes over, the joys that fly,
    The tears that follow fast;
   And the dirtiest things we do must lie
    Forgotten at the last;
    Even Love goes past.

   What's left behind I shall not find,
    The splendour and the pain;
   The splash of sun, the shouting wind,
    And the brave sting of rain,
    I may not meet again.

   But the years, that take the best away,
    Give something in the end;
   And a better friend than love have they,
    For none to mar or mend,
    That have themselves to friend.

   I shall desire and I shall find
    The best of my desires;
   The autumn road, the mellow wind
    That soothes the darkening shires.
    And laughter, and inn-fires.

   White mist about the black hedgerows,
    The slumbering Midland plain,
   The silence where the clover grows,
    And the dead leaves in the lane,
    Certainly, these remain.

   And I shall find some girl perhaps,
    And a better one than you,
   With eyes as wise, but kindlier,
    And lips as soft, but true.
    And I daresay she will do.

   I came back late and tired last night
    Into my little room,
   To the long chair and the firelight
    And comfortable gloom.

   But as I entered softly in
    I saw a woman there,
   The line of neck and cheek and chin,
    The darkness of her hair,
   The form of one I did not know
    Sitting in my chair.

   I stood a moment fierce and still,
    Watching her neck and hair.
   I made a step to her; and saw
    That there was no one there.

   It was some trick of the firelight
    That made me see her there.
   It was a chance of shade and light
    And the cushion in the chair.

   Oh, all you happy over the earth,
    That night, how could I sleep?
   I lay and watched the lonely gloom;
    And watched the moonlight creep
   From wall to basin, round the room,
    All night I could not sleep.

   Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
    The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
   Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,
    Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes

   Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
    Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train
   Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,
    Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . .

   As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,
    Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;
   And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,
    Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move

   Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;
    And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,
   Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,
    Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,

   Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,
    Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .
   -- There is an end appointed, O my soul!
    Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom

   Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
    Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,
   Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.
    The white lights roar.  The sounds of the world die.

   And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
    Speed sharpens; grows.  Into the night, and on,
   The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
    The lamps fade; and the stars.  We are alone.

   All suddenly the wind comes soft,
    And Spring is here again;
   And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green,
    And my heart with buds of pain.

   My heart all Winter lay so numb,
    The earth so dead and frore,
   That I never thought the Spring would come,
    Or my heart wake any more.

   But Winter's broken and earth has woken,
    And the small birds cry again;
   And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,
    And my heart puts forth its pain.

   When Beauty and Beauty meet
    All naked, fair to fair,
   The earth is crying-sweet,
    And scattering-bright the air,
   Eddying, dizzying, closing round,
    With soft and drunken laughter;
   Veiling all that may befall
    After -- after --

   Where Beauty and Beauty met,
    Earth's still a-tremble there,
   And winds are scented yet,
    And memory-soft the air,
   Bosoming, folding glints of light,
    And shreds of shadowy laughter;
   Not the tears that fill the years
    After -- after --

   The way that lovers use is this;
    They bow, catch hands, with never a word,
   And their lips meet, and they do kiss,
    -- So I have heard.

   They queerly find some healing so,
    And strange attainment in the touch;
   There is a secret lovers know,
    -- I have read as much.

   And theirs no longer joy nor smart,
    Changing or ending, night or day;
   But mouth to mouth, and heart on heart,
    -- So lovers say.

   Young Mary, loitering once her garden way,
   Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day,
   As wine that blushes water through.  And soon,
   Out of the gold air of the afternoon,
   One knelt before her:  hair he had, or fire,
   Bound back above his ears with golden wire,
   Baring the eager marble of his face.
   Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace
   Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,
   And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,
   Incurious.  Calm as his wings, and fair,
   That presence filled the garden.
                                     She stood there,
   Saying, "What would you, Sir?"
                                   He told his word,
   "Blessed art thou of women!"  Half she heard,
   Hands folded and face bowed, half long had known,
   The message of that clear and holy tone,
   That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart;
   Such serene tidings moved such human smart.
   Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow.
   Her hands crept up her breast.  She did but know
   It was not hers.  She felt a trembling stir
   Within her body, a will too strong for her
   That held and filled and mastered all.  With eyes
   Closed, and a thousand soft short broken sighs,
   She gave submission; fearful, meek, and glad. . . .

   She wished to speak.  Under her breasts she had
   Such multitudinous burnings, to and fro,
   And throbs not understood; she did not know
   If they were hurt or joy for her; but only
   That she was grown strange to herself, half lonely,
   All wonderful, filled full of pains to come
   And thoughts she dare not think, swift thoughts and dumb,
   Human, and quaint, her own, yet very far,
   Divine, dear, terrible, familiar . . .
   Her heart was faint for telling; to relate
   Her limbs' sweet treachery, her strange high estate,
   Over and over, whispering, half revealing,
   Weeping; and so find kindness to her healing.
   'Twixt tears and laughter, panic hurrying her,
   She raised her eyes to that fair messenger.
   He knelt unmoved, immortal; with his eyes
   Gazing beyond her, calm to the calm skies;
   Radiant, untroubled in his wisdom, kind.
   His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind.
   How should she, pitiful with mortality,
   Try the wide peace of that felicity
   With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart,
   And hints of human ecstasy, human smart,
   And whispers of the lonely weight she bore,
   And how her womb within was hers no more
   And at length hers?
                        Being tired, she bowed her head;
   And said, "So be it!"
                          The great wings were spread
   Showering glory on the fields, and fire.
   The whole air, singing, bore him up, and higher,
   Unswerving, unreluctant.  Soon he shone
   A gold speck in the gold skies; then was gone.

   The air was colder, and grey.  She stood alone.

   The day that YOUTH had died,
   There came to his grave-side,
   In decent mourning, from the country's ends,
   Those scatter'd friends
   Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
   And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
   In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,
   The days and nights and dawnings of the time
   When YOUTH kept open house,
   Nor left untasted
   Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,
   No quest of his unshar'd --
   All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar'd,
   Followed their old friend's bier.
   FOLLY went first,
   With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers'd;
   And after trod the bearers, hat in hand --
   LAUGHTER, most hoarse, and Captain PRIDE with tanned
   And martial face all grim, and fussy JOY,
   Who had to catch a train, and LUST, poor, snivelling boy;
   These bore the dear departed.
   Behind them, broken-hearted,
   Came GRIEF, so noisy a widow, that all said,
   "Had he but wed
   Her elder sister SORROW, in her stead!"
   And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,
   The fatherless children, COLOUR, TUNE, and RHYME
   (The sweet lad RHYME), ran all-uncomprehending.
   Then, at the way's sad ending,
   Round the raw grave they stay'd.  Old WISDOM read,
   In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.
   There stood ROMANCE,
   The furrowing tears had mark'd her rouged cheek;
   Poor old CONCEIT, his wonder unassuaged;
   Dead INNOCENCY's daughter, IGNORANCE;
   And shabby, ill-dress'd GENEROSITY;
   And ARGUMENT, too full of woe to speak;
   PASSION, grown portly, something middle-aged;
   And FRIENDSHIP -- not a minute older, she;
   IMPATIENCE, ever taking out his watch;
   FAITH, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch
   Old WISDOM's endless drone.
   BEAUTY was there,
   Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.
   Poor maz'd IMAGINATION; FANCY wild;
   ARDOUR, the sunlight on his greying hair;
   CONTENTMENT, who had known YOUTH as a child
   And never seen him since.  And SPRING came too,
   Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers --
   She did not stay for long.
   And TRUTH, and GRACE, and all the merry crew,
   The laughing WINDS and RIVERS, and lithe HOURS;
   And HOPE, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing SONG; --
   Yes, with much woe and mourning general,
   At dead YOUTH's funeral,
   Even these were met once more together, all,
   Who erst the fair and living YOUTH did know;
   All, except only LOVE.  LOVE had died long ago.

   Just now the lilac is in bloom,
   All before my little room;
   And in my flower-beds, I think,
   Smile the carnation and the pink;
   And down the borders, well I know,
   The poppy and the pansy blow . . .
   Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through,
   Beside the river make for you
   A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep
   Deeply above; and green and deep
   The stream mysterious glides beneath,
   Green as a dream and deep as death.
   -- Oh, damn!  I know it! and I know
   How the May fields all golden show,
   And when the day is young and sweet,
   Gild gloriously the bare feet
   That run to bathe . . .
                         'Du lieber Gott!'

   Here am I, sweating, sick, and hot,
   And there the shadowed waters fresh
   Lean up to embrace the naked flesh.
   Temperamentvoll German Jews
   Drink beer around; -- and THERE the dews
   Are soft beneath a morn of gold.
   Here tulips bloom as they are told;
   Unkempt about those hedges blows
   An English unofficial rose;
   And there the unregulated sun
   Slopes down to rest when day is done,
   And wakes a vague unpunctual star,
   A slippered Hesper; and there are
   Meads towards Haslingfield and Coton
   Where das Betreten's not verboten.

   In Grantchester, in Grantchester! --
   Some, it may be, can get in touch
   With Nature there, or Earth, or such.
   And clever modern men have seen
   A Faun a-peeping through the green,
   And felt the Classics were not dead,
   To glimpse a Naiad's reedy head,
   Or hear the Goat-foot piping low: . . .
   But these are things I do not know.
   I only know that you may lie
   Day long and watch the Cambridge sky,
   And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass,
   Hear the cool lapse of hours pass,
   Until the centuries blend and blur
   In Grantchester, in Grantchester. . . .
   Still in the dawnlit waters cool
   His ghostly Lordship swims his pool,
   And tries the strokes, essays the tricks,
   Long learnt on Hellespont, or Styx.
   Dan Chaucer hears his river still
   Chatter beneath a phantom mill.
   Tennyson notes, with studious eye,
   How Cambridge waters hurry by . . .
   And in that garden, black and white,
   Creep whispers through the grass all night;
   And spectral dance, before the dawn,
   A hundred Vicars down the lawn;
   Curates, long dust, will come and go
   On lissom, clerical, printless toe;
   And oft between the boughs is seen
   The sly shade of a Rural Dean . . .
   Till, at a shiver in the skies,
   Vanishing with Satanic cries,
   The prim ecclesiastic rout
   Leaves but a startled sleeper-out,
   Grey heavens, the first bird's drowsy calls,
   The falling house that never falls.

   God!  I will pack, and take a train,
   And get me to England once again!
   For England's the one land, I know,
   Where men with Splendid Hearts may go;
   And Cambridgeshire, of all England,
   The shire for Men who Understand;
   And of THAT district I prefer
   The lovely hamlet Grantchester.
   For Cambridge people rarely smile,
   Being urban, squat, and packed with guile;
   And Royston men in the far South
   Are black and fierce and strange of mouth;
   At Over they fling oaths at one,
   And worse than oaths at Trumpington,
   And Ditton girls are mean and dirty,
   And there's none in Harston under thirty,
   And folks in Shelford and those parts
   Have twisted lips and twisted hearts,
   And Barton men make Cockney rhymes,
   And Coton's full of nameless crimes,
   And things are done you'd not believe
   At Madingley on Christmas Eve.
   Strong men have run for miles and miles,
   When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;
   Strong men have blanched, and shot their wives,
   Rather than send them to St. Ives;
   Strong men have cried like babes, bydam,
   To hear what happened at Babraham.
   But Grantchester! ah, Grantchester!
   There's peace and holy quiet there,
   Great clouds along pacific skies,
   And men and women with straight eyes,
   Lithe children lovelier than a dream,
   A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream,
   And little kindly winds that creep
   Round twilight corners, half asleep.
   In Grantchester their skins are white;
   They bathe by day, they bathe by night;
   The women there do all they ought;
   The men observe the Rules of Thought.
   They love the Good; they worship Truth;
   They laugh uproariously in youth;
   (And when they get to feeling old,
   They up and shoot themselves, I'm told) . . .

   Ah God! to see the branches stir
   Across the moon at Grantchester!
   To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten
   Unforgettable, unforgotten
   River-smell, and hear the breeze
   Sobbing in the little trees.
   Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand
   Still guardians of that holy land?
   The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,
   The yet unacademic stream?
   Is dawn a secret shy and cold
   Anadyomene, silver-gold?
   And sunset still a golden sea
   From Haslingfield to Madingley?
   And after, ere the night is born,
   Do hares come out about the corn?
   Oh, is the water sweet and cool,
   Gentle and brown, above the pool?
   And laughs the immortal river still
   Under the mill, under the mill?
   Say, is there Beauty yet to find?
   And Certainty? and Quiet kind?
   Deep meadows yet, for to forget
   The lies, and truths, and pain? . . . oh! yet
   Stands the Church clock at ten to three?
   And is there honey still for tea?

   Stars that seem so close and bright,
   Watched by lovers through the night,
   Swim in emptiness, men say,
   Many a mile and year away.

   And yonder star that burns so white,
   May have died to dust and night
   Ten, maybe, or fifteen year,
   Before it shines upon my dear.

   Oh! often among men below,
   Heart cries out to heart, I know,
   And one is dust a many years,
   Child, before the other hears.

   Heart from heart is all as far,
   Fafaia, as start from star.

  I strayed about the deck, an hour, to-night
   Under a cloudy moonless sky; and peeped
   In at the windows, watched my friends at table,
   In the windows, watched my friends at table,
   Or playing cards, or standing in the doorway,
   Or coming out into the darkness. Still
   No one could see me.

                 I would have thought of them
   --Heedless, within a week of battle--in pity,
   Pride in their strength and in the weight and firmness
   And link'd beauty of bodies, and pity that
   This gay machine of splendour 'ld soon be broken,
   Thought little of, pashed, scattered, . . .

                                        Only, always,
   I could but see them--against the lamplight--pass
   Like coloured shadows, thinner than filmy glass,
   Slight bubbles, fainter than the wave's faint light,
   That broke to phosphorus out in the night,
   Perishing things and strange ghosts--soon to die
   To other ghosts--this one, or that or I.

   As the Wind, and as the Wind,
       In a corner of the way,
   Goes stepping, stands twirling,
   Invisibly, comes whirling,
   Bows before, and skips behind,
     In a grave, an endless play--

   So my Heart, and so my Heart,
       Following where your feet have gone,
   Stirs dust of old dreams there;
   He turns a toe; he gleams there,
   Treading you a dance apart.
     But you see not. You pass on.

   The way of love was thus.
   He was born one winter morn
   With hands delicious,
   And it was well with us.

   Love came our quiet way,
   Lit pride in us, and died in us,
   All in a winter's day.
   There is no more to say.

   Sometimes even now I may
   Steal a prisoner's holiday,
   Slip, when all is worst, the bands,
     Hurry back, and duck beneath
   Time's old tyrannous groping hands,
     Speed away with laughing breath
   Back to all I'll never know,
   Back to you, a year ago.

   Truant there from Time and Pain,
   What I had, I find again:
   Sunlight in the boughs above,
     Sunlight in your hair and dress,
   The hands too proud for all but Love,
     The Lips of utter kindliness,
   The Heart of bravery swift and clean
     Where the best was safe, I knew,
   And laughter in the gold and green,
     And song, and friends, and ever you
   With smiling and familiar eyes,
     You--but friendly: you--but true.

   And Innocence accounted wise,
     And Faith the fool, the pitiable.
   Love so rare, one would swear
     All of earth for ever well--

   Careless lips and flying hair,
     And little things I may not tell.

   It does but double the heart-ache
   When I wake, when I wake.

   The Thing must End. I am no boy! I am
    No BOY! I being twenty-one. Uncle, you make
    A great mistake, a very great mistake,
   In chiding me for letting slip a "Damn!"
   What's more, you called me "Mother's one ewe
         lamb,"
    Bade me "refrain from swearing--for her sake--
    Till I'm grown up" . . . --By God! I think you
         take
   Too much upon you, Uncle William!

   You say I am your brother's only son.
   I know it. And, "What of it?" I reply.
   My heart's resolved. Something must be done.
   So shall I curb, so baffle, so suppress
   This too avuncular officiousness,
   Intolerable consanguinity.

   Sir, since the last Elizabethan died,
   Or, rather, that more Paradisal muse,
   Blind with much light, passed to the light more glorious
   Or deeper blindness, no man's hand, as thine,
   Has, on the world's most noblest chord of song,
   Struck certain magic strains. Ears satiate
   With the clamorous, timorous whisperings of to-day,
   Thrilled to perceive once more the spacious voice
   And serene utterance of old. We heard
   --With rapturous breath half-held, as a dreamer dreams
   Who dares not know it dreaming, lest he wake--
   The odorous, amorous style of poetry,
   The melancholy knocking of those lines,
   The long, low soughing of pentameters,
   --Or the sharp of rhyme as a bird's cry--
   And the innumerable truant polysyllables
   Multitudinously twittering like a bee.
   Fulfilled our hearts were with that music then,
   And all the evenings sighed it to the dawn,
   And all the lovers heard it from all the trees.
   All of the accents upon all the norms!
   --And ah! the stress on the penultimate!
   We never knew blank verse could have such feet.

   Where is it now? Oh, more than ever, now
   I sometimes think no poetry is read
   Save where some sepultured Caesura bled,
   Royally incarnadining all the line.
   Is the imperial iamb laid to rest,
   And the young trochee, having done enough?

   Ah! turn again! Sing so to us, who are sick
   Of seeming-simple rhymes, bizarre emotions,
   Decked in the simple verses of the day,
   Infinite meaning in the little gloom,
   Irregular thoughts in stanzas regular,
   Modern despair in antique meters, myths
   Incomprehensible at evening,
   And symbols that mean nothing in the dawn.
   The slow lines swell. The new styles sighs. The Celt
   Moans round with many voices.

                                       God! to see
   Gaunt anapaests stand up out of the verse,
   Combative accents, stress where no stress should be,
   Spondee on spondee, iamb on choriamb,
   The thrill of the all the tribrachs in the world,
   And all the vowels rising to the E!
   To hear the blessed mutter of those verbs,
   Conjunctions passionate toward each other's arms,
   And epithets like amaranthine lovers
   Stretching luxuriously to the stars,
   All prouder pronouns than the dawn, and all
   The thunder of the trumpets of the noun!

   There is an evil which that Race attaints
   Who represent God's World with oily paints,
   Who mock the Universe, so rare and sweet,
   With spots of colour on a canvas sheet,
   Defile the Lovely and insult the Good
   By scrawling upon little bits of wood.
   They'd snare the moon, and catch the immortal sun
   With madder brown and pale vermilion,
   Entrap an English evening's magic hush . . .

   They say when the Great Prompter's hand shall ring
    Down the last curtain upon earth and sea,
    All the Good Mimes will have eternity
   To praise their Author, worship love and sing;
   Or to the walls of Heaven wandering
    Look down on those damned for a fretful d----,
    Mock them (all theologians agree
   On this reward for virtue), laugh, and fling

   New sulphur on the sin-incarnadined . . .
    Ah, Love! still temporal, and still atmospheric,
     Teleologically unperturbed,
   We share a peace by no divine divined,
    An earthly garden hidden from any cleric,
     Untrodden of God, by no Eternal curbed.

   Hand trembling towards hand; the amazing lights
   Of heart and eye. They stood on supreme heights.

   Ah, the delirious weeks of honeymoon!
    Soon they returned, and after strange adventures,
   Settled at Balham by the end of June,
    Their money was in Can. Pacs. B. Debentures,
   And in Antofagastas. Still he went
    Cityward daily; still she did abide
   At home. And both were really quite content
    With work and social pleasures. Then they died.
   They left three children (beside George, who drank);
    The eldest Jane, who married Mr. Bell,
   William, the head-clerk in the County Bank,
    And Henry, a stock-broker, doing well.

   I have known the most dear that is granted us here,
    More supreme than the gods know above,
   Like a star I was hurled through the sweet of the world,
    And the height and the light of it, Love.
   I have risen to the uttermost Heaven of Joy,
    I have sunk to the sheer Hell of Pain--
   But--it's not going to happen again, my boy,
    It's not going to happen again.

   It's the very first word that poor Juliet heard
    From her Romeo over the Styx;
   And the Roman will tell Cleopatra in hell
    When she starts her immortal old tricks;
   What Paris was tellin' for good-bye to Helen
    When he bundled her into the train--
   Oh, it's not going to happen again, old girl,
    It's not going to happen again.

     All in the town were still asleep,
     When the sun came up with a shout and a leap.
     In the lonely streets unseen by man,
     A little dog danced. And the day began.

   All his life he'd been good, as far as he could,
   And the poor little beast had done all that he should.
   But this morning he swore, by Odin and Thor
   And the Canine Valhalla--he'd stand it no more!

   So his prayer he got granted--to do just what he wanted,
   Prevented by none, for the space of one day.
   "Jam incipiebo [1], sedere facebo [2],"
   In dog-Latin he quoth, "Euge! sophos! hurray!"

   He fought with the he-dogs, and winked at the she-dogs,
   A thing that had never been heard of before.
   "For the stigma of gluttony, I care not a button!" he
   Cried, and ate all he could swallow--and more.

   He took sinewy lumps from the shins of old frumps,
   And mangled the errand-boys--when he could get 'em.
   He shammed furious rabies, and bit all the babies [3],
   And followed the cats up the trees, and then ate' em!

   They thought 'twas the devil was holding a revel,
   And sent for the parson to drive him away;
   For the town never knew such a hullabaloo
   As that little dog raised--till the end of that day.

     When the blood-red sun had gone burning down,
     And the lights were lit in the little town,
     Outside, in the gloom of the twilight grey,
     The little dog died when he'd had his day.

   In alien earth, across a troubled sea,
    His body lies that was so fair and young.
    His mouth is stopped, with half his songs unsung;
   His arm is still, that struck to make men free.
   But let no cloud of lamentation be
    Where, on a warrior's grave, a lyre is hung.
    We keep the echoes of his golden tongue,
   We keep the vision of his chivalry.

   So Israel's joy, the loveliest of kings,
    Smote now his harp, and now the hostile horde.
   To-day the starry roof of Heaven rings
    With psalms a soldier made to praise his Lord;
   And David rests beneath Eternal wings,
    Song on his lips, and in his hand a sword.

   Your face was lifted to the golden sky
    Ablaze beyond the black roofs of the square
    As flame on flame leapt, flourishing in air
   Its tumult of red stars exultantly
   To the cold constellations dim and high:
    And as we neared the roaring ruddy flare
    Kindled to gold your throat and brow and hair
   Until you burned, a flame of ecstasy.

   The golden head goes down into the night
    Quenched in cold gloom -- and yet again you stand
   Beside me now with lifted face alight,
   As, flame to flame, and fire to fire you burn . . .
   Then, recollecting, laughingly you turn,
    And look into my eyes and take my hand.  

   Once in my garret -- you being far away
    Tramping the hills and breathing upland air,
    Or so I fancied -- brooding in my chair,
   I watched the London sunshine feeble and grey
   Dapple my desk, too tired to labour more,
    When, looking up, I saw you standing there
    Although I'd caught no footstep on the stair,
   Like sudden April at my open door.

   Though now beyond earth's farthest hills you fare,
    Song-crowned, immortal, sometimes it seems to me
    That, if I listen very quietly,
   Perhaps I'll hear a light foot on the stair
   And see you, standing with your angel air,
    Fresh from the uplands of eternity.

   Your eyes rejoiced in colour's ecstasy,
    Fulfilling even their uttermost desire,
    When, over a great sunlit field afire
   With windy poppies streaming like a sea
   Of scarlet flame that flaunted riotously
    Among green orchards of that western shire,
    You gazed as though your heart could never tire
   Of life's red flood in summer revelry.

   And as I watched you, little thought had I
   How soon beneath the dim low-drifting sky
    Your soul should wander down the darkling way,
   With eyes that peer a little wistfully,
   Half-glad, half-sad, remembering, as they see
    Lethean poppies, shrivelling ashen grey.

   October chestnuts showered their perishing gold
    Over us as beside the stream we lay
    In the Old Vicarage garden that blue day,
   Talking of verse and all the manifold
   Delights a little net of words may hold,
    While in the sunlight water-voles at play
    Dived under a trailing crimson bramble-spray,
   And walnuts thudded ripe on soft black mould.

   Your soul goes down unto a darker stream
    Alone, O friend, yet even in death's deep night
       Your eyes may grow accustomed to the dark
   And Styx for you may have the ripple and gleam
       Of your familiar river, and Charon's bark
    Tarry by that old garden of your delight.

   Though we, a happy few,
   Indubitably knew
   That from the purple came
   This poet of pure flame,

   The world first saw his light
   Flash on an evil night,
   And heard his song from far
   Above the drone of war.

   Out of the primal dark
   He leapt, like lyric lark,
   Singing his aubade strain;
   Then fell to earth again.

   We garner all he gave,
   And on his hero grave,
   For love and honour strew,
   Rosemary, myrtle, rue.

   Son of the Morning, we
   Had kept you thankfully;
   But yours the asphodel:
   Hail, singer, and farewell!

They told me Pan was dead, but I
  Oft marvelled who it was that sang
Down the green valleys languidly
  Where the grey elder-thickets hang.

Sometimes I thought it was a bird
  My soul had charged with sorcery;
Sometimes it seemed my own heart heard
  Inland the sorrow of the sea.

But even where the primrose sets
  The seal of her pale loveliness,
I found amid the violets
  Tears of an antique bitterness.

"What voice is that I hear
  Crying across the pool?"
"It is the voice of Pan you hear,
Crying his sorceries shrill and clear,
  In the twilight dim and cool."

 "What song is it he sings,
  Echoing from afar;
While the sweet swallow bends her wings,
Filling the air with twitterings,
  Beneath the brightening star?"

The woodman answered me,
  His faggot on his back:--
"Seek not the face of Pan to see;
Flee from his clear note summoning thee
  To darkness deep and black!"

 "He dwells in thickest shade,
  Piping his notes forlorn
Of sorrow never to be allayed;
Turn from his coverts sad
  Of twilight unto morn!"

The woodman passed away
  Along the forest path;
His ax shone keen and grey
In the last beams of day:
  And all was still as death:--

Only Pan singing sweet
  Out of Earth's fragrant shade;
I dreamed his eyes to meet,
And found but shadow laid
  Before my tired feet.

Comes no more dawn to me,
  Nor bird of open skies.
Only his woods' deep gloom I see
  Till, at the end of all, shall rise,
Afar and tranquilly,
Death's stretching sea.

  Winter is fallen early
  On the house of Stare;
Birds in reverberating flocks
  Haunt its ancestral box;
  Bright are the plenteous berries
  In clusters in the air.

  Still is the fountain's music,
  The dark pool icy still,
Whereupon a small and sanguine sun
  Floats in a mirror on,
  Into a West of crimson,
  From a South of daffodil.

  'Tis strange to see young children
  In such a wintry house;
Like rabbits' on the frozen snow
  Their tell-tale footprints go;
  Their laughter rings like timbrels
  'Neath evening ominous:

  Their small and heightened faces
  Like wine-red winter buds;
Their frolic bodies gentle as
  Flakes in the air that pass,
  Frail as the twirling petal
  From the briar of the woods.

  Above them silence lours,
  Still as an arctic sea;
Light fails; night falls; the wintry moon
  Glitters; the crocus soon
  Will ope grey and distracted
  On earth's austerity:

  Thick mystery, wild peril,
  Law like an iron rod:--
Yet sport they on in Spring's attire,
  Each with his tiny fire
  Blown to a core of ardour
  By the awful breath of God.

This ugly old crone--
Every beauty she had
When a maid, when a maid.
Her beautiful eyes,
Too youthful, too wise,
Seemed ever to come
To so lightless a home,
Cold and dull as a stone.
And her cheeks--who would guess
Cheeks cadaverous as this
Once with colours were gay
As the flower on its spray?
Who would ever believe
Aught could bring one to grieve
So much as to make
Lips bent for love's sake
So thin and so grey?
O Youth, come away!
As she asks in her lone,
This old, desolate crone.
She loves us no more;
She is too old to care
For the charms that of yore
Made her body so fair.
Past repining, past care,
She lives but to bear
One or two fleeting years
Earth's indifference: her tears
Have lost now their heat;
Her hands and her feet
Now shake but to be
Shed as leaves from a tree;
And her poor heart beats on
Like a sea--the storm gone.
Art thou asleep? or have thy wings
Wearied of my unchanging skies?
Or, haply, is it fading dreams
    Are in my eyes?

Not even an echo in my heart
Tells me the courts thy feet trod last,
Bare as a leafless wood it is,
    The summer past.

My inmost mind is like a book
The reader dulls with lassitude,
Wherein the same old lovely words
    Sound poor and rude.

Yet through this vapid surface, I
Seem to see old-time deeps; I see,
Past the dark painting of the hour,
    Life's ecstasy.

Only a moment; as when day
Is set, and in the shade of night,
Through all the clouds that compassed her,
    Stoops into sight

Pale, changeless, everlasting Dian,
Gleams on the prone Endymion,
Troubles the dulness of his dreams:
    And then is gone.

The sky was like a waterdrop
  In shadow of a thorn,
Clear, tranquil, beautiful,
  Dark, forlorn.

Lightning along its margin ran;
  A rumour of the sea
Rose in profundity and sank
  Into infinity.

Lofty and few the elms, the stars
  In the vast boughs most bright;
I stood a dreamer in a dream
  In the unstirring night.

Not wonder, worship, not even peace
  Seemed in my heart to be:
Only the memory of one,
  Of all most dead to me.

She had amid her ringlets bound
Green leaves to rival their dark hue;
How could such locks with beauty bound
      Dry up their dew,
    Wither them through and through?

She had within her dark eyes lit
Sweet fires to burn all doubt away;
Yet did those fires, in darkness lit,
      Burn but a day,
    Not even till twilight stay.

She had within a dusk of words
A vow in simple splendour set;
How, in the memory of such words,
      Could she forget
    That vow--the soul of it?


I knocked upon thy door ajar,
While yet the woods with buds were grey;
Nought but a little child I heard
    Warbling at break of day.

I knocked when June had lured her rose
To mask the sharpness of its thorn;
Knocked yet again, heard only yet
    Thee singing of the morn.

The frail convolvulus had wreathed
Its cup, but the faint flush of eve
Lingered upon thy Western wall;
    Thou hadst no word to give.

Once yet I came; the winter stars
Above thy house wheeled wildly bright;
Footsore I stood before thy door--
    Wide open into night.

Who beckons the green ivy up
  Its solitary tower of stone?
What spirit lures the bindweed's cup
      Unfaltering on?
Calls even the starry lichen to climb
By agelong inches endless Time?

Who bids the hollyhock uplift
  Her rod of fast-sealed buds on high;
Fling wide her petals--silent, swift,
      Lovely to the sky?
Since as she kindled, so she will fade,
Flower above flower in squalor laid.

Ever the heavy billow rears
  All its sea-length in green, hushed wall;
But totters as the shore it nears,
      Foams to its fall;
Where was its mark? on what vain quest
Rose that great water from its rest?

So creeps ambition on; so climb
  Man's vaunting thoughts. He, set on high,
Forgets his birth, small space, brief time,
      That he shall die;
Dreams blindly in his dark, still air;
Consumes his strength; strips himself bare;

Rejects delight, ease, pleasure, hope,
  Seeking in vain, but seeking yet,
Past earthly promise, earthly scope,
      On one aim set:
As if, like Chaucer's child, he thought
All but "O Alma!" nought.

Like an old battle, youth is wild
With bugle and spear, and counter cry,
Fanfare and drummery, yet a child
Dreaming of that sweet chivalry,
The piercing terror cannot see.

He, with a mild and serious eye
Along the azure of the years,
Sees the sweet pomp sweep hurtling by;
But he sees not death's blood and tears,
Sees not the plunging of the spears.

And all the strident horror of
Horse and rider, in red defeat,
Is only music fine enough
To lull him into slumber sweet
In fields where ewe and lambkin bleat.

O, if with such simplicity
Himself take arms and suffer war;
With beams his targe shall gilded be,
Though in the thickening gloom be far
The steadfast light of any star!

Though hoarse War's eagle on him perch,
Quickened with guilty lightnings--there
It shall in vain for terror search,
Where a child's eyes beneath bloody hair
Gaze purely through the dingy air.

And when the wheeling rout is spent,
Though in the heaps of slain he lie;
Or lonely in his last content;
Quenchless shall burn in secrecy
The flame Death knows his victors by.

Wilt thou never come again,
Beauteous one?
Yet the woods are green and dim,
Yet the birds' deluding cry
Echoes in the hollow sky,
Yet the falling waters brim
The clear pool which thou wast fain
To paint thy lovely cheek upon,
    Beauteous one!

I may see the thorny rose
    Stir and wake
The dark dewdrop on her gold;
But thy secret will she keep
Half-divulged--yet all untold,
Since a child's heart woke from sleep.

The faltering sunbeam fades and goes;
The night-bird whistles in the brake;
    The willows quake;
Utter darkness walls; the wind
    Sighs no more.
Yet it seems the silence yearns
But to catch thy fleeting foot;
Yet the wandering glowworm burns
Lest her lamp should light thee not--
Thee whom I shall never find;
Though thy shadow lean before,
Thou thyself return'st no more--
    Never more.

All the world's woods, tree o'er tree,
    Come to nought.
Birds, flowers, beasts, how transient they,
Angels of a flying day.
Love is quenched; dreams drown in sleep;
Ruin nods along the deep:
Only thou immortally
    Hauntest on
This poor earth in Time's flux caught;
Hauntest on, pursued, unwon,
Phantom child of memory,
    Beauteous one!

Who is it calling by the darkened river
  Where the moss lies smooth and deep,
And the dark trees lean unmoving arms,
  Silent and vague in sleep,
And the bright-heeled constellations pass
  In splendour through the gloom;
Who is it calling o'er the darkened river
      In music, "Come!"?

Who is it wandering in the summer meadows
  Where the children stoop and play
In the green faint-scented flowers, spinning
  The guileless hours away?
Who touches their bright hair? who puts
  A wind-shell to each cheek,
Whispering betwixt its breathing silences,
      "Seek! seek!"?

Who is it watching in the gathering twilight
  When the curfew bird hath flown
On eager wings, from song to silence,
  To its darkened nest alone?
Who takes for brightening eyes the stars,
  For locks the still moonbeam,
Sighs through the dews of evening peacefully
      Falling, "Dream!"?

If thou art sweet as they are sad
  Who on the shores of Time's salt sea
Watch on the dim horizon fade
  Ships bearing love to night and thee;

If past all beacons Hope hath lit
  In the dark wanderings of the deep
They who unwilling traverse it
  Dream not till dawn unseal their sleep;

Ah, cease not in thy winds to mock
  Us, who yet wake, but cannot see
Thy distant shores; who at each shock
  Of the waves' onset faint for thee!

Dearest, it was a night
That in its darkness rocked Orion's stars;
A sighing wind ran faintly white
Along the willows, and the cedar boughs
Laid their wide hands in stealthy peace across
The starry silence of their antique moss:
No sound save rushing air
Cold, yet all sweet with Spring,
And in thy mother's arms, couched weeping there,
    Thou, lovely thing.

Who, now, put dreams into thy slumbering mind?
Who, with bright Fear's lean taper, crossed a hand
Athwart its beam, and stooping, truth maligned,
Spake so thy spirit speech should understand,
And with a dread "He's dead!" awaked a peal
Of frenzied bells along the vacant ways
Of thy poor earthly heart; waked thee to steal,
Like dawn distraught upon unhappy days,
To prove nought, nothing? Was it Time's large voice
Out of the inscrutable future whispered so?
Or but the horror of a little noise
Earth wakes at dead of night? Or does Love know
When his sweet wings weary and droop, and even
In sleep cries audibly a shrill remorse?
Or, haply, was it I who out of dream
Stole but a little where shadows course,
Called back to thee across the eternal stream?

None, none can tell where I shall be
When the unclean earth covers me;
Only in surety if thou cry
Where my perplexed ashes lie,
Know, 'tis but death's necessity
That keeps my tongue from answering thee.

Even if no more my shadow may
Lean for a moment in thy day;
No more the whole earth lighten, as if,
Thou near, it had nought else to give:
Surely 'tis but Heaven's strategy
To prove death immortality.

Yet should I sleep--and no more dream,
Sad would the last awakening seem,
If my cold heart, with love once hot,
Had thee in sleep remembered not:
How could I wake to find that I
Had slept alone, yet easefully?

Or should in sleep glad visions come:
Sick, in an alien land, for home
Would be my eyes in their bright beam;
Awake, we know 'tis not a dream;
Asleep, some devil in the mind
Might truest thoughts with false enwind.

Life is a mockery if death
Have the least power men say it hath.
As to a hound that mewing waits,
Death opens, and shuts to, his gates;
Else even dry bones might rise and say,--
"'Tis _ye_ are dead and laid away."

Innocent children out of nought
Build up a universe of thought,
And out of silence fashion Heaven:
So, dear, is this poor dying even,
Seeing thou shall be touched, heard, seen,
Better than when dust stood between.

Thou canst not see him standing by--
Time--with a poppied hand
Stealing thy youth's simplicity,
Even as falls unceasingly
    His waning sand.

He will pluck thy childish roses, as
    Summer from her bush
Strips all the loveliness that was;
Even to the silence evening has
    Thy laughter hush.

Thy locks too faint for earthly gold,
    The meekness of thine eyes,
He will darken and dim, and to his fold
Drive, 'gainst the night, thy stainless, old
    Innocencies;

Thy simple words confuse and mar,
    Thy tenderest thoughts delude,
Draw a long cloud athwart thy star,
Still with loud timbrels heaven's far
    Faint interlude.

Thou canst not see; I see, dearest;
    O, then, yet patient be,
Though love refuse thy heart all rest,
Though even love wax angry, lest
    Love should lose _thee_?

Ever before my face there went
  Betwixt earth's buds and me
A beauty beyond earth's content,
  A hope--half memory:
Till in the woods one evening--
  Ah! eyes as dark as they,
Fastened on mine unwontedly,
  Grey, and dear heart, how grey!

"What is the world, O soldiers?
It is I:
I, this incessant snow,
  This northern sky;
Soldiers, this solitude
  Through which we go
      Is I."

No lovelier hills than thine have laid
  My tired thoughts to rest:
No peace of lovelier valleys made
  Like peace within my breast.

Thine are the woods whereto my soul,
  Out of the noontide beam,
Flees for a refuge green and cool
  And tranquil as a dream.

Thy breaking seas like trumpets peal;
  Thy clouds--how oft have I
Watched their bright towers of silence steal
  Into infinity!

My heart within me faults to roam
  In thought even far from thee:
Thine be the grave whereto I come,
  And thine my darkness be.

Far inland here Death's pinions mocked the roar
    Of English seas;
We sleep to wake no more,
    Hushed, and at ease;
Till sound a trump, shore on to echoing shore,
Rouse from a peace, unwonted then to war,
    Us and our enemies.

When twilight darkens, and one by one,
The sweet birds to their nests have gone;
When to green banks the glow-worms bring
Pale lamps to brighten evening;
Then stirs in his thick sleep the owl
Through the dewy air to prowl.

Hawking the meadows swiftly he flits,
While the small mouse atrembling sits
With tiny eye of fear upcast
Until his brooding shape be past,
Hiding her where the moonbeams beat,
Casting black shadows in the wheat.

Now all is still: the field-man is
Lapped deep in slumbering silentness.
Not a leaf stirs, but clouds on high
Pass in dim flocks across the sky,
Puffed by a breeze too light to move
Aught but these wakeful sheep above.

O what an arch of light now spans
These fields by night no longer Man's!
Their ancient Master is abroad,
Walking beneath the moonlight cold:
His presence is the stillness, He
Fills earth with wonder and mystery.

All from the light of the sweet moon
    Tired men lie now abed;
Actionless, full of visions, soon
    Vanishing, soon sped.

The starry night aflock with beams
    Of crystal light scarce stirs:
Only its birds--the cocks, the streams,
    Call 'neath heaven's wanderers.

All silent; all hearts still;
    Love, cunning, fire fallen low:
When faint morn straying on the hill
    Sighs, and his soft airs flow.

I heard a little child beneath the stars
    Talk as he ran along
To some sweet riddle in his mind that seemed
    A-tiptoe into song.

In his dark eyes lay a wild universe,--
    Wild forests, peaks, and crests;
Angels and fairies, giants, wolves and he
    Were that world's only guests.

Elsewhere was home and mother, his warm bed:--
    Now, only God alone
Could, armed with all His power and wisdom, make
    Earths richer than his own.

O Man!--thy dreams, thy passions, hopes, desires!--
    He in his pity keep
A homely bed where love may lull a child's
    Fond Universe asleep!

Upon a bank, easeless with knobs of gold,
  Beneath a canopy of noonday smoke,
I saw a measureless Beast, morose and bold,
  With eyes like one from filthy dreams awoke,
Who stares upon the daylight in despair
For very terror of the nothing there.

This beast in one flat hand clutched vulture-wise
  A glittering image of itself in jet,
And with the other groped about its eyes
  To drive away the dreams that pestered it;
And never ceased its coils to toss and beat
The mire encumbering its feeble feet.

Sharp was its hunger, though continually
  It seemed a cud of stones to ruminate,
And often like a dog let glittering lie
  This meatless fare, its foolish gaze to sate;
Once more convulsively to stoop its jaw,
Or seize the morsel with an envious paw.

Indeed, it seemed a hidden enemy
  Must lurk within the clouds above that bank,
It strained so wildly its pale, stubborn eye,
  To pierce its own foul vapours dim and dank;
Till, wearied out, it raved in wrath and foam,
Daring that Nought Invisible to come.

Ay, and it seemed some strange delight to find
  In this unmeaning din, till, suddenly,
As if it heard a rumour on the wind,
  Or far away its freer children cry,
Lifting its face made-quiet, there it stayed,
Till died the echo its own rage had made.

That place alone was barren where it lay;
  Flowers bloomed beyond, utterly sweet and fair;
And even its own dull heart might think to stay
  In livelong thirst of a clear river there,
Flowing from unseen hills to unheard seas,
Through a still vale of yew and almond trees.

And then I spied in the lush green below
  Its tortured belly, One, like silver, pale,
With fingers closed upon a rope of straw,
  That bound the Beast, squat neck to hoary tail;
Lonely in all that verdure faint and deep,
He watched the monster as a shepherd sheep.

I marvelled at the power, strength, and rage
  Of this poor creature in such slavery bound;
Tettered with worms of fear; forlorn with age;
  Its blue wing-stumps stretched helpless on the ground;
While twilight faded into darkness deep,
And he who watched it piped its pangs asleep.

I saw old Idleness, fat, with great cheeks
Puffed to the huge circumference of a sigh,
But past all tinge of apples long ago.
His boyish fingers twiddled up and down
The filthy remnant of a cup of physic
That thicked in odour all the while he stayed.
His eyes were sad as fishes that swim up
And stare upon an element not theirs
Through a thin skin of shrewish water, then
Turn on a languid fin, and dip down, down,
Into unplumbed, vast, oozy deeps of dream.
His stomach was his master, and proclaimed it;
And never were such meagre puppets made
The slaves of such a tyrant, as his thoughts
Of that obese epitome of ills.
Trussed up he sat, the mockery of himself;
And when upon the wan green of his eye
I marked the gathering lustre of a tear,
Thought I myself must weep, until I caught
A grey, smug smile of satisfaction smirch
His pallid features at his misery.
And laugh did I, to see the little snares
He had set for pests to vex him: his great feet
Prisoned in greater boots; so narrow a stool
To seat such elephantine parts as his;
Ay, and the book he read, a Hebrew Bible;
And, to incite a gross and backward wit,
An old, crabbed, wormed, Greek dictionary; and
A foxy Ovid bound in dappled calf.

Still as a mountain with dark pines and sun
He stood between the armies, and his shout
Rolled from the empyrean above the host:
"Bid any little flea ye have come forth,
And wince at death upon my finger-nail!"
He turned his large-boned face; and all his steel
Tossed into beams the lustre of the noon;
And all the shaggy horror of his locks
Rustled like locusts in a field of corn.
The meagre pupil of his shameless eye
Moved like a cormorant over a glassy sea.
He stretched his limbs, and laughed into the air,
To feel the groaning sinews of his breast,
And the long gush of his swollen arteries pause:
And, nodding, wheeled, towering in all his height.
Then, like a wind that hushes, gazed and saw
Down, down, far down upon the untroubled green
A shepherd-boy that swung a little sling.
Goliath shut his lids to drive that mote,
Which vexed the eastern azure of his eye,
Out of his vision; and stared down again.
Yet stood the youth there, ruddy in the flare
Of his vast shield, nor spake, nor quailed, gazed up,
As one might scan a mountain to be scaled.
Then, as it were, a voice unearthly still
Cried in the cavern of his bristling ear,
"His name is Death!" ... And, like the flush
That dyes Sahara to its lifeless verge,
His brows' bright brass flamed into sudden crimson;
And his great spear leapt upward, lightning-like,
Shaking a dreadful thunder in the air;
Spun betwixt earth and sky, bright as a berg
That hoards the sunlight in a myriad spires,
Crashed: and struck echo through an army's heart.
Then paused Goliath, and stared down again.
And fleet-foot Fear from rolling orbs perceived
Steadfast, unharmed, a stooping shepherd-boy
Frowning upon the target of his face.
And wrath tossed suddenly up once more his hand;
And a deep groan grieved all his strength in him.
He breathed; and, lost in dazzling darkness, prayed--
Besought his reins, his gloating gods, his youth:
And turned to smite what he no more could see.
Then sped the singing pebble-messenger,
The chosen of the Lord from Israel's brooks,
Fleet to its mark, and hollowed a light path
Down to the appalling Babel of his brain.
And like the smoke of dreaming Souffrière
Dust rose in cloud, spread wide, slow silted down
Softly all softly on his armour's blaze.

'Twas in a tavern that with old age stooped
And leaned rheumatic rafters o'er his head--
A blowzed, prodigious man, which talked, and stared,
And rolled, as if with purpose, a small eye
Like a sweet Cupid in a cask of wine.
I could not view his fatness for his soul,
Which peeped like harmless lightnings and was gone;
As haps to voyagers of the summer air.
And when he laughed, Time trickled down those beams,
As in a glass; and when in self-defence
He puffed that paunch, and wagged that huge, Greek head,
Nosed like a Punchinello, then it seemed
An hundred widows swept in his small voice,
Now tenor, and now bass of drummy war.
He smiled, compact of loam, this orchard man;
Mused like a midnight, webbed with moonbeam snares
Of flitting Love; woke--and a King he stood,
Whom all the world hath in sheer jest refused
For helpless laughter's sake. And then, forfend!
Bacchus and Jove reared vast Olympus there;
And Pan leaned leering from Promethean eyes.
"Lord!" sighed his aspect, weeping o'er the jest,
"What simple mouse brought such a mountain forth?"

Rose, like dim battlements, the hills and reared
Steep crags into the fading primrose sky;
But in the desolate valleys fell small rain,
Mingled with drifting cloud. I saw one come,
Like the fierce passion of that vacant place,
His face turned glittering to the evening sky;
His eyes, like grey despair, fixed satelessly
On the still, rainy turrets of the storm;
And all his armour in a haze of blue.
He held no sword, bare was his hand and clenched,
As if to hide the inextinguishable blood
Murder had painted there. And his wild mouth
Seemed spouting echoes of deluded thoughts.
Around his head, like vipers all distort,
His locks shook, heavy-laden, at each stride.
If fire may burn invisible to the eye;
O, if despair strive everlastingly;
Then haunted here the creature of despair,
Fanning and fanning flame to lick upon
A soul still childish in a blackened hell.

What dost thou here far from thy native place?
What piercing influences of heaven have stirred
Thy heart's last mansion all-corruptible to wake,
To move, and in the sweets of wine and fire
Sit tempting madness with unholy eyes?
Begone, thou shuddering, pale anomaly!
The dark presses without on yew and thorn;
Stoops now the owl upon her lonely quest;
The pomp runs high here, and our beauteous women
Seek no cold witness--O, let murder cry,
Too shrill for human ear, only to God.
Come not in power to wreak so wild a vengeance!
Thou knowest not now the limit of man's heart;
He is beyond thy knowledge. Gaze not then,
Horror enthroned lit with insanest light!

Along an avenue of almond-trees
Came three girls chattering of their sweethearts three.
And lo! Mercutio, with Byronic ease,
Out of his philosophic eye cast all
A mere flowered twig of thought, whereat--
Three hearts fell still as when an air dies out
And Venus falters lonely o'er the sea.
But when within the further mist of bloom
His step and form were hid, the smooth child Ann
Said, "La, and what eyes he had!" and Lucy said,
"How sad a gentleman!" and Katherine,
"I wonder, now, what mischief he was at."
And these three also April hid away,
Leaving the Spring faint with Mercutio.

In old-world nursery vacant now of children,
With posied walls, familiar, fair, demure,
And facing southward o'er romantic streets,
Sits yet and gossips winter's dark away
One gloomy, vast, glossy, and wise, and sly:
And at her side a cherried country cousin.
Her tongue claps ever like a ram's sweet bell;
There's not a name but calls a tale to mind--
Some marrowy patty of farce or melodram;
There's not a soldier but hath babes in view;
There's not on earth what minds not of the midwife:
"O, widowhood that left me still espoused!"
Beauty she sighs o'er, and she sighs o'er gold;
Gold will buy all things, even a sweet husband,
Else only Heaven is left and--farewell youth!
Yet, strangely, in that money-haunted head,
The sad, gemmed crucifix and incense blue
Is childhood once again. Her memory
Is like an ant-hill which a twig disturbs,
But twig stilled never. And to see her face,
Broad with sleek homely beams; her babied hands,
Ever like 'lighting doves, and her small eyes--
Blue wells a-twinkle, arch and lewd and pious--
To darken all sudden into Stygian gloom,
And paint disaster with uplifted whites,
Is life's epitome. She prates and prates--
A waterbrook of words o'er twelve small pebbles.
And when she dies--some grey, long, summer evening,
When the bird shouts of childhood through the dusk,
'Neath night's faint tapers--then her body shall
Lie stiff with silks of sixty thrifty years.

A dark lean face, a narrow, slanting eye,
Whose deeps of blackness one pale taper's beam
Haunts with a fitting madness of desire;
A heart whose cinder at the breath of passion
Glows to a momentary core of heat
Almost beyond indifference to endure:
So parched Iago frets his life away.
His scorn works ever in a brain whose wit
This world hath fools too many and gross to seek.
Ever to live incredibly alone,
Masked, shivering, deadly, with a simple Moor
Of idiot gravity, and one pale flower
Whose chill would quench in everlasting peace
His soul's unmeasured flame--O paradox!
Might he but learn the trick!--to wear her heart
One fragile hour of heedless innocence,
And then, farewell, and the incessant grave.
"O fool! O villain!"--'tis the shuttlecock
Wit never leaves at rest. It is his fate
To be a needle in a world of hay,
Where honour is the flattery of the fool;
Sin, a tame bauble; lies, a tiresome jest;
Virtue, a silly, whitewashed block of wood
For words to fell. Ah! but the secret lacking,
The secret of the child, the bird, the night,
Faded, flouted, bespattered, in days so far
Hate cannot bitter them, nor wrath deny;
Else were this Desdemona.... Why!
Woman a harlot is, and life a nest
Fouled by long ages of forked fools. And God--
Iago deals not with a tale so dull:
To have made the world! Fie on thee, Artisan!


Even she too dead! all languor on her brow,
All mute humanity's last simpleness,--
And yet the roses in her cheeks unfallen!
Can death haunt silence with a silver sound?
Can death, that hushes all music to a close,
Pluck one sweet wire scarce-audible that trembles,
As if a little child, called Purity,
Sang heedlessly on of his dear Imogen?
Surely if some young flowers of Spring were put
Into the tender hollow of her heart,
'Twould faintly answer, trembling in their petals.
Poise but a wild bird's feather, it will stir
On lips that even in silence wear the badge
Only of truth. Let but a cricket wake,
And sing of home, and bid her lids unseal
The unspeakable hospitality of her eyes.
O childless soul--call once her husband's name!
And even if indeed from these green hills
Of England, far, her spirit flits forlorn,
Back to its youthful mansion it will turn,
Back to the floods of sorrow these sweet locks
Yet heavy bear in drops; and Night shall see
Unwearying as her stars still Imogen,
Pausing 'twixt death and life on one hushed word.

There haunts in Time's bare house an active ghost,
Enamoured of his name, Polonius.
He moves small fingers much, and all his speech
Is like a sampler of precisest words,
Set in the pattern of a simpleton.
His mirth floats eerily down chill corridors;
His sigh--it is a sound that loves a keyhole;
His tenderness a faint court-tarnished thing;
His wisdom prates as from a wicker cage;
His very belly is a pompous nought;
His eye a page that hath forgot his errand.
Yet in his brain--his spiritual brain--
Lies hid a child's demure, small, silver whistle
Which, to his horror, God blows, unawares,
And sets men staring. It is sad to think,
Might he but don indeed thin flesh and blood,
And pace important to Law's inmost room,
He would see, much marvelling, one immensely wise,
Named Bacon, who, at sound of his youth's step,
Would turn and call him Cousin--for the likeness.

There runs a crisscross pattern of small leaves
Espalier, in a fading summer air,
And there Ophelia walks, an azure flower,
Whom wind, and snowflakes, and the sudden rain
Of love's wild skies have purified to heaven.
There is a beauty past all weeping now
In that sweet, crooked mouth, that vacant smile;
Only a lonely grey in those mad eyes,
Which never on earth shall learn their loneliness.
And when amid startled birds she sings lament,
Mocking in hope the long voice of the stream,
It seems her heart's lute hath a broken string.
Ivy she hath, that to old ruin clings;
And rosemary, that sees remembrance fade;
And pansies, deeper than the gloom of dreams;
But ah! if utterable, would this earth
Remain the base, unreal thing it is?
Better be out of sight of peering eyes;
Out--out of hearing of all-useless words,
Spoken of tedious tongues in heedless ears.
And lest, at last, the world should learn heart-secrets;
Lest that sweet wolf from some dim thicket steal;
Better the glassy horror of the stream.

Umbrageous cedars murmuring symphonies
Stooped in late twilight o'er dark Denmark's Prince:
He sat, his eyes companioned with dream--
Lustrous large eyes that held the world in view
As some entrancèd child's a puppet show.
Darkness gave birth to the all-trembling stars,
And a far roar of long-drawn cataracts,
Flooding immeasurable night with sound.
He sat so still, his very thoughts took wing,
And, lightest Ariels, the stillness haunted
With midge-like measures; but, at last, even they
Sank 'neath the influences of his night.
The sweet dust shed faint perfume in the gloom;
Through all wild space the stars' bright arrows fell
On the lone Prince--the troubled son of man--
On Time's dark waters in unearthly trouble:
Then, as the roar increased, and one fair tower
Of cloud took sky and stars with majesty,
He rose, his face a parchment of old age,
Sorrow hath scribbled o'er, and o'er, and o'er.

I saw sweet Poetry turn troubled eyes
  On shaggy Science nosing in the grass,
  For by that way poor Poetry must pass
On her long pilgrimage to Paradise.
He snuffled, grunted, squealed; perplexed by flies,
  Parched, weatherworn, and near of sight, alas,
  From peering close where very little was
In dens secluded from the open skies.

But Poetry in bravery went down,
  And called his name, soft, clear, and fearlessly;
Stooped low, and stroked his muzzle overgrown;
Refreshed his drought with dew; wiped pure and free
  His eyes: and lo! laughed loud for joy to see
In those grey deeps the azure of her own.

Come, then, with showers; I love thy cloudy face
  Gilded with splendour of the sunbeam thro'
  The heedless glory of thy locks. I know
The arch, sweet languor of thy fleeting grace,
The windy lovebeams of thy dwelling-place,
  Thy dim dells where in azure bluebells blow,
  The brimming rivers where thy lightnings go
Harmless and full and swift from race to race.

Thou takest all young hearts captive with thine eyes;
  At rumour of thee the tongues of children ring
Louder than bees; the golden poplars rise
  Like trumps of peace; and birds, on homeward wing,
Fly mocking echoes shrill along the skies,
  Above the waves' grave diapasoning.

My heart faints in me for the distant sea.
  The roar of London is the roar of ire
  The lion utters in his old desire
For Libya out of dim captivity.
The long bright silver of Cheapside I see,
  Her gilded weathercocks on roof and spire
  Exulting eastward in the western fire;
All things recall one heart-sick memory:--

Ever the rustle of the advancing foam,
  The surges' desolate thunder, and the cry
  As of some lone babe in the whispering sky;
Ever I peer into the restless gloom
  To where a ship clad dim and loftily
Looms steadfast in the wonder of her home.

My mind is like a clamorous market-place.
  All day in wind, rain, sun, its babel wells;
  Voice answering to voice in tumult swells.
Chaffering and laughing, pushing for a place,
My thoughts haste on, gay, strange, poor, simple, base;
  This one buys dust, and that a bauble sells:
  But none to any scrutiny hints or tells
The haunting secrets hidden in each sad face.

Dies down the clamour when the dark draws near;
  Strange looms the earth in twilight of the West,
Lonely with one sweet star serene and clear,
  Dwelling, when all this place is hushed to rest,
  On vacant stall, gold, refuse, worst and best,
Abandoned utterly in haste and fear.

By chance my fingers, resting on my face,
  Stayed suddenly where in its orbit shone
  The lamp of all things beautiful; then on,
Following more heedfully, did softly trace
Each arch and prominence and hollow place
  That shall revealed be when all else is gone--
  Warmth, colour, roundness--to oblivion,
And nothing left but darkness and disgrace.

Life like a moment passed seemed then to be;
  A transient dream this raiment that it wore;
While spelled my hand out its mortality
  Made certain all that had seemed doubt before:
Proved--O how vaguely, yet how lucidly!--
  How much death does; and yet can do no more.

I laid my inventory at the hand
  Of Death, who in his gloomy arbour sate;
  And while he conned it, sweet and desolate
I heard Love singing in that quiet land.
He read the record even to the end--
  The heedless, livelong injuries of Fate,
  The burden of foe, the burden of love and hate;
The wounds of foe, the bitter wounds of friend:

All, all, he read, ay, even the indifference,
  The vain talk, vainer silence, hope and dream.
He questioned me: "What seek'st thou then instead?"
  I bowed my face in the pale evening gleam.
Then gazed he on me with strange innocence:
"Even in the grave thou wilt have thyself," he said.

"Come now," I said, "put off these webs of death,
  Distract this leaden yearning of thine eyes
  From lichened banks of peace, sad mysteries
Of dust fallen-in where passed the flitting breath:
Turn thy sick thoughts from him that slumbereth
  In mouldered linen to the living skies,
  The sun's bright-clouded principalities,
The salt deliciousness the sea-breeze hath!

"Lay thy warm hand on earth's cold clods and think
  What exquisite greenness sprouts from these to grace
The moving fields of summer; on the brink
  Of archèd waves the sea-horizon trace,
Whence wheels night's galaxy; and in silence sink
  The pride in rapture of life's dwelling-place!"

"Ever exulting in thyself, on fire
  To flaunt the purple of the Universe,
  To strut and strut, and thy great part rehearse;
Ever the slave of every proud desire;
Come now a little down where sports thy sire;
  Choose thy small better from thy abounding worse;
  Prove thou thy lordship who hadst dust for nurse,
And for thy swaddling the primeval mire!"

Then stooped our Manhood nearer, deep and still,
  As from earth's mountains an unvoyaged sea,
Hushed my faint voice in its great peace until
  It seemed but a bird's cry in eternity;
And in its future loomed the undreamable,
  And in its past slept simple men like me.

Her breast is cold; her hands how faint and wan!
  And the deep wonder of her starry eyes
  Seemingly lost in cloudless Paradise,
And all earth's sorrow out of memory gone.
Yet sings her clear voice unrelenting on
  Of loveliest impossibilities;
  Though echo only answer her with sighs
Of effort wasted and delights foregone.

Spent, baffled, 'wildered, hated and despised,
  Her straggling warriors hasten to defeat;
By wounds distracted, and by night surprised,
  Fall where death's darkness and oblivion meet:
Yet, yet: O breast how cold! O hope how far!
Grant my son's ashes lie where these men's are!

Bring not bright candles, for his eyes
  In twilight have sweet company;
Bring not bright candles, else they fly--
  His phantoms fly--
Gazing aggrieved on thee!

Bring not bright candles, startle not
  The phantoms of a vacant room,
Flocking above a child that dreams--
  Deep, deep in dreams,--
Hid, in the gathering gloom!

Bring not bright candles to those eyes
  That between earth and stars descry,
Lovelier for the shadows there,
  Children of air,
Palaces in the sky!

The shadow of a poplar tree
  Lay in that lake of sun,
As I with my little sword went in--
  Against a thousand, one.

Haughty and infinitely armed,
  Insolent in their wrath,
Plumed high with purple plumes they held
  The narrow meadow path.

The air was sultry; all was still;
  The sun like flashing glass;
And snip-snap my light-whispering steel
  In arcs of light did pass.

Lightly and dull fell each proud head,
  Spiked keen without avail,
Till swam my uncontented blade
  With ichor green and pale.

And silence fell: the rushing sun
  Stood still in paths of heat,
Gazing in waves of horror on
  The dead about my feet.

Never a whir of wing, no bee
  Stirred o'er the shameful slain;
Nought but a thirsty wasp crept in,
  Stooped, and came out again.

The very air trembled in fear;
  Eclipsing shadow seemed
Rising in crimson waves of gloom--
  On one who dreamed.

"Who called?" I said, and the words
  Through the whispering glades,
Hither, thither, baffled the birds--
  "Who called? Who called?"

The leafy boughs on high
  Hissed in the sun;
The dark air carried my cry
  Faintingly on:

Eyes in the green, in the shade,
  In the motionless brake,
Voices that said what I said,
  For mockery's sake:

"Who cares?" I bawled through my tears;
  The wind fell low:
In the silence, "Who cares? who cares?"
  Wailed to and fro.

I know where lurk
The eyes of Fear;
I, I alone,
Where shadowy-clear,
Watching for me,
Lurks Fear.

'Tis ever still
And dark, despite
All singing and
All candlelight,
'Tis ever cold,
And night.

He touches me;
Says quietly,
"Stir not, nor whisper,
I am nigh;
Walk noiseless on,
I am by!"

He drives me
As a dog a sheep;
Like a cold stone
I cannot weep.
He lifts me
Hot from sleep

In marble hands
To where on high
The jewelled horror
Of his eye
Dares me to struggle
Or cry.

No breast wherein
To chase away
That watchful shape!
Vain, vain to say
"Haunt not with night
The Day!"

Sand, sand; hills of sand;
  And the wind where nothing is
Green and sweet of the land;
  No grass, no trees,
  No bird, no butterfly,
But hills, hills of sand,
  And a burning sky.

Sea, sea, mounds of the sea,
  Hollow, and dark, and blue,
Flashing incessantly
  The whole sea through;
  No flower, no jutting root,
Only the floor of the sea,
  With foam afloat.

Blow, blow, winding shells;
  And the watery fish,
Deaf to the hidden bells,
  In the water splash;
No streaming gold, no eyes,
  Watching along the waves,
But far-blown shells, faint bells,
  From the darkling caves.

There is a garden, grey
  With mists of autumntide;
Under the giant boughs,
  Stretched green on every side,

Along the lonely paths,
  A little child like me,
With face, with hands, like mine,
  Plays ever silently;

On, on, quite silently,
  When I am there alone,
Turns not his head; lifts not his eyes;
  Heeds not as he plays on.

After the birds are flown
  From singing in the trees,
When all is grey, all silent,
  Voices, and winds, and bees;

And I am there alone:
  Forlornly, silently,
Plays in the evening garden
  Myself with me.

There is a wind where the rose was;
Cold rain where sweet grass was;
  And clouds like sheep
  Stream o'er the steep
Grey skies where the lark was.

Nought gold where your hair was;
Nought warm where your hand was;
  But phantom, forlorn,
  Beneath the thorn,
Your ghost where your face was.

Sad winds where your voice was;
Tears, tears where my heart was;
  And ever with me,
  Child, ever with me,
Silence where hope was.

Green Mistletoe!
Oh, I remember now
A dell of snow,
Frost on the bough;
None there but I:
Snow, snow, and a wintry sky.

None there but I,
And footprints one by one,
Zigzaggedly,
Where I had run;
Where shrill and powdery
A robin sat in the tree.

And he whistled sweet;
And I in the crusted snow
With snow-clubbed feet
Jigged to and fro,
Till, from the day,
The rose-light ebbed away.

And the robin flew
Into the air, the air,
The white mist through;
And small and rare
The night-frost fell
In the calm and misty dell.

And the dusk gathered low,
And the silver moon and stars
On the frozen snow
Drew taper bars,
Kindled winking fires
In the hooded briers.

And the sprawling Bear
Growled deep in the sky;
And Orion's hair
Streamed sparkling by:
But the North sighed low,
"Snow, snow, more snow!"

  There were three cherry trees once,
  Grew in a garden all shady;
And there for delight of so gladsome a sight,
  Walked a most beautiful lady,
  Dreamed a most beautiful lady.

  Birds in those branches did sing,
  Blackbird and throstle and linnet,
But she walking there was by far the most fair--
  Lovelier than all else within it,
  Blackbird and throstle and linnet.

  But blossoms to berries do come,
  All hanging on stalks light and slender,
And one long summer's day charmed that lady away,
  With vows sweet and merry and tender;
  A lover with voice low and tender.

  Moss and lichen the green branches deck;
  Weeds nod in its paths green and shady:
Yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams,
  The ghost of that beautiful lady,
  That happy and beautiful lady.

When Susan's work was done, she would sit,
With one fat guttering candle lit,
And window opened wide to win
The sweet night air to enter in.
There, with a thumb to keep her place,
She would read, with stern and wrinkled face,
Her mild eyes gliding very slow
Across the letters to and fro,
While wagged the guttering candle flame
In the wind that through the window came.
And sometimes in the silence she
Would mumble a sentence audibly,
Or shake her head as if to say,
"You silly souls, to act this way!"
And never a sound from night I would hear,
Unless some far-off cock crowed clear;
Or her old shuffling thumb should turn
Another page; and rapt and stern,
Through her great glasses bent on me,
She would glance into reality;
And shake her round old silvery head,
With--"You!--I thought you was in bed!"--
Only to tilt her book again,
And rooted in Romance remain.

Sad is old Ben Tristlewaite,
  Now his day is done,
And all his children
  Far away are gone.

He sits beneath his jasmined porch,
  His stick between his knees,
His eyes fixed vacant
  On his moss-grown trees.

Grass springs in the green path,
  His flowers are lean and dry,
His thatch hangs in wisps against
  The evening sky.

He has no heart to care now,
  Though the winds will blow
Whistling in his casement,
  And the rain drip through.

He thinks of his old Bettie,
  How she'd shake her head and say,
"You'll live to wish my sharp old tongue
  Could scold--some day."

But as in pale high autumn skies
  The swallows float and play,
His restless thoughts pass to and fro,
  But nowhere stay.

Soft, on the morrow, they are gone;
  His garden then will be
Denser and shadier and greener,
  Greener the moss-grown tree.

When thin-strewn memory I look through,
I see most clearly poor Miss Loo,
Her tabby cat, her cage of birds,
Her nose, her hair, her muffled words,
And how she would open her green eyes,
As if in some immense surprise,
Whenever as we sat at tea
She made some small remark to me.

'Tis always drowsy summer when
From out the past she comes again;
The westering sunshine in a pool
Floats in her parlour still and cool;
While the slim bird its lean wires shakes,
As into piercing song it breaks;
Till Peter's pale-green eyes ajar
Dream, wake; wake, dream, in one brief bar.
And I am sitting, dull and shy,
And she with gaze of vacancy,

And large hands folded on the tray,
Musing the afternoon away;
Her satin bosom heaving slow
With sighs that softly ebb and flow.
And her plain face in such dismay,
It seems unkind to look her way:
Until all cheerful back will come
Her gentle gleaming spirit home:
And one would think that poor Miss Loo
Asked nothing else, if she had you.

Few footsteps stray when dusk droops o'er
The tailor's old stone-lintelled door.
There sits he stitching half asleep,
Beside his smoky tallow dip.
"Click, click," his needle hastes, and shrill
Cries back the cricket beneath the sill.
Sometimes he stays, and over his thread
Leans sidelong his old tousled head;
Or stoops to peer with half-shut eye
When some strange footfall echoes by;
Till clearer gleams his candle's spark
Into the dusty summer dark.
Then from his crosslegs he gets down,
To find how dark the evening is grown;
And hunched-up in his door he will hear
The cricket whistling crisp and clear;
And so beneath the starry grey
Will mutter half a seam away.

"Once ... once upon a time ..."
  Over and over again,
Martha would tell us her stories,
  In the hazel glen.

Hers were those clear grey eyes
  You watch, and the story seems
Told by their beautifulness
  Tranquil as dreams.

She would sit with her two slim hands
  Clasped round her bended knees;
While we on our elbows lolled,
  And stared at ease.

Her voice and her narrow chin,
  Her grave small lovely head,
Seemed half the meaning
  Of the words she said.

"Once ... once upon a time ..."
  Like a dream you dream in the night,
Fairies and gnomes stole out
  In the leaf-green light.

And her beauty far away
  Would fade, as her voice ran on,
Till hazel and summer sun
  And all were gone:

All fordone and forgot;
  And like clouds in the height of the sky,
Our hearts stood still in the hush
  Of an age gone by.

As Ann came in one summer's day,
  She felt that she must creep,
So silent was the clear cool house,
  It seemed a house of sleep.
And sure, when she pushed open the door,
  Rapt in the stillness there,
Her mother sat, with stooping head,
  Asleep upon a chair;
Fast--fast asleep; her two hands laid
  Loose-folded on her knee,
So that her small unconscious face
  Looked half unreal to be:
So calmly lit with sleep's pale light
  Each feature was; so fair
Her forehead--every trouble was
  Smoothed out beneath her hair.
But though her mind in dream now moved,
  Still seemed her gaze to rest--
From out beneath her fast-sealed lids,
  Above her moving breast--
On Ann; as quite, quite still she stood;
  Yet slumber lay so deep
Even her hands upon her lap
  Seemed saturate with sleep.
And as Ann peeped, a cloudlike dread
  Stole over her, and then,
On stealthy, mouselike feet she trod,
  And tiptoed out again.

While at her bedroom window once,
  Learning her task for school,
Little Louisa lonely sat
  In the morning clear and cool,
She slanted her small bead-brown eyes
  Across the empty street,
And saw Death softly watching her
  In the sunshine pale and sweet.

His was a long lean sallow face;
  He sat with half-shut eyes,
Like an old sailor in a ship
  Becalmed 'neath tropic skies.
Beside him in the dust he had set
  His staff and shady hat;
These, peeping small, Louisa saw
  Quite clearly where she sat--

The thinness of his coal-black locks,
  His hands so long and lean
They scarcely seemed to grasp at all
  The keys that hung between:
Both were of gold, but one was small,
  And with this last did he
Wag in the air, as if to say,
  "Come hither, child, to me!"

Louisa laid her lesson book
  On the cold window-sill;
And in the sleepy sunshine house
  Went softly down, until
She stood in the half-opened door,
  And peeped. But strange to say,
Where Death just now had sunning sat
  Only a shadow lay:
Just the tall chimney's round-topped cowl,
  And the small sun behind,
Had with its shadow in the dust
  Called sleepy Death to mind.
But most she thought how strange it was
  Two keys that he should bear,
And that, when beckoning, he should wag
  The littlest in the air.

Rachel sings sweet--
  Oh yes, at night,
Her pale face bent
  In the candle-light,
Her slim hands touch
  The answering keys,
And she sings of hope
  And of memories:
Sings to the little
  Boy that stands
Watching those slim,
  Light, heedful hands.
He looks in her face;
  Her dark eyes seem
Dark with a beautiful
  Distant dream;
And still she plays,
  Sings tenderly
To him of hope,
  And of memory.

A very old woman
Lives in yon house.
The squeak of the cricket,
The stir of the mouse,
Are all she knows
Of the earth and us.

Once she was young,
Would dance and play,
Like many another
Young popinjay;
And run to her mother
At dusk of day.

And colours bright
She delighted in;
The fiddle to hear,
And to lift her chin,
And sing as small
As a twittering wren.

But age apace
Comes at last to all;
And a lone house filled
With the cricket's call;
And the scampering mouse
In the hollow wall.

Shadow and light both strove to be
The eight bell-ringers' company,
As with his gliding rope in hand,
Counting his changes, each did stand;
While rang and trembled every stone,
To music by the bell-mouths blown:
Till the bright clouds that towered on high
Seemed to re-echo cry with cry.
Still swang the clappers to and fro,
When, in the far-spread fields below,
I saw a ploughman with his team
Lift to the bells and fix on them
His distant eyes, as if he would
Drink in the utmost sound he could;
While near him sat his children three,
And in the green grass placidly
Played undistracted on, as if
What music earthly bells might give
Could only faintly stir their dream,
And stillness make more lovely seem.
Soon night hid horses, children, all
In sleep deep and ambrosial.
Yet, yet, it seemed, from star to star,
Welling now near, now faint and far,
Those echoing bells rang on in dream,
And stillness made even lovelier seem.

All winter through I bow my head
  Beneath the driving rain;
The North Wind powders me with snow
  And blows me back again;
At midnight 'neath a maze of stars
  I flame with glittering rime,
And stand, above the stubble, stiff
  As mail at morning-prime.
But when that child, called Spring, and all
  His host of children, come,
Scattering their buds and dew upon
  These acres of my home,
Some rapture in my rags awakes;
  I lift void eyes and scan
The skies for crows, those ravening foes,
  Of my strange master, Man.
I watch him striding lank behind
  His clashing team, and know
Soon will the wheat swish body high
  Where once lay sterile snow;
Soon shall I gaze across a sea
  Of sun-begotten grain,
Which my unflinching watch hath sealed
  For harvest once again.

Softly along the road of evening,
  In a twilight dim with rose,
Wrinkled with age, and drenched with dew,
  Old Nod, the shepherd, goes.

His drowsy flock streams on before him,
  Their fleeces charged with gold,
To where the sun's last beam leans low
  On Nod the shepherd's fold.

The hedge is quick and green with brier,
  From their sand the conies creep;
And all the birds that fly in heaven
  Flock singing home to sleep.

His lambs outnumber a noon's roses,
  Yet, when night's shadows fall,
His blind old sheep-dog, Slumber-soon,
  Misses not one of all.

His are the quiet steeps of dreamland,
  The waters of no-more-pain,
His ram's bell rings 'neath an arch of stars,
  "Rest, rest, and rest again."


The bindweed roots pierce down
  Deeper than men do lie,
Laid in their dark-shut graves
  Their slumbering kinsmen by.

Yet what frail thin-spun flowers
  She casts into the air,
To breathe the sunshine, and
  To leave her fragrance there.

But when the sweet moon comes,
  Showering her silver down,
Half-wreathèd in faint sleep,
  They droop where they have blown.

So all the grass is set,
  Beneath her trembling ray,
With buds that have been flowers,
  Brimmed with reflected day.

Clouded with snow
  The cold winds blow,
And shrill on leafless bough
The robin with its burning breast
  Alone sings now.

  The rayless sun,
  Day's journey done,
Sheds its last ebbing light
On fields in leagues of beauty spread
  Unearthly white.

  Thick draws the dark,
  And spark by spark,
The frost-fires kindle, and soon
Over that sea of frozen foam
  Floats the white moon.

There blooms no bud in May
  Can for its white compare
With snow at break of day,
  On fields forlorn and bare.

For shadow it hath rose,
  Azure, and amethyst;
And every air that blows
  Dies out in beauteous mist.

It hangs the frozen bough
  With flowers on which the night
Wheeling her darkness through
  Scatters a starry light.

Fearful of its pale glare
  In flocks the starlings rise;
Slide through the frosty air,
  And perch with plaintive cries.

Only the inky rook,
  Hunched cold in ruffled wings,
Its snowy nest forsook,
  Caws of unnumbered Springs.

    Not any flower that blows
    But shining watch doth keep;
Every swift changing chequered hour it knows
Now to break forth in beauty; now to sleep.

    This for the roving bee
    Keeps open house, and this
Stainless and clear is, that in darkness she
May lure the moth to where her nectar is.

    Lovely beyond the rest
    Are these of all delight:--
The tiny pimpernel that noon loves best,
The primrose palely burning through the night.

    One 'neath day's burning sky
    With ruby decks her place,
The other when Eve's chariot glideth by
Lifts her dim torch to light that dreaming face.



No one was with me there--
Happy I was--alone;
Yet from the sunshine suddenly
    A joy was gone.

A bird in an empty house
Sad echoes makes to ring,
Flitting from room to room
    On restless wing:

Till from its shades he flies,
And leaves forlorn and dim
The narrow solitudes
   So strange to him.

So, when with fickle heart
I joyed in the passing day,
A presence my mood estranged
    Went grieved away.

The thin moonlight with trickling ray,
Thridding the boughs of silver may,
Trembles in beauty, pale and cool,
On folded flower, and mantled pool.
All in a haze the rushes lean--
And he--he sits, with chin between
His two cold hands; his bare feet set
Deep in the grasses, green and wet.
About his head a hundred rings
Of gold loop down to meet his wings,
Whose feathers, arched their stillness through,
Gleam with slow-gathering drops of dew.
The mouse-bat peers; the stealthy vole
Creeps from the covert of its hole;
A shimmering moth its pinions furls,
Grey in the moonshine of his curls;
'Neath the faint stars the night-airs stray,
Scattering the fragrance of the may;
And with each stirring of the bough
Shadow beclouds his childlike brow.

Be gentle, O hands of a child;
Be true: like a shadowy sea
In the starry darkness of night
    Are your eyes to me.

But words are shallow, and soon
Dreams fade that the heart once knew;
And youth fades out in the mind,
    In the dark eyes too.

What can a tired heart say,
Which the wise of the world have made dumb?
Save to the lonely dreams of a child,
    "Return again, come!"

The words you said grow faint;
  The lamps you lit burn dim;
Yet, still be near your faithless friend
  To urge and counsel him.

Still with returning feet
  To where life's shadows brood,
With steadfast eyes made clear in death
  Haunt his vague solitude.

So he, beguiled with earth,
  Yet with its vain things vexed,
Keep even to his own heart unknown
  Your memory unperplexed.

Darker than night; and oh, much darker she,
Whose eyes in deep night darkness gaze on me.
No stars surround her; yet the moon seems hid
Afar somewhere, beneath that narrow lid.
She darkens against the darkness; and her face
Only by adding thought to thought I trace,
Limned shadowily: O dream, return once more
To gloomy Hades and the whispering shore!

Be angry now no more!
  If I have grieved thee--if
Thy kindness, mine before,
No hope may now restore:
  Only forgive, forgive!

If still resentment burns
  In thy cold breast, oh if
No more to pity turns,
No more, once tender, yearns
  Thy love; oh yet forgive!...

Ask of the winter rain
June's withered rose again:
Ask grace of the salt sea:
She will not answer thee.
God would ten times have shriven
A heart so riven;
In her cold care thou would'st be
Still unforgiven.

Had the gods loved me I had lain
  Where darnel is, and thorn,
And the wild night-bird's nightlong strain
  Trembles in boughs forlorn.

Nay, but they loved me not; and I
  Must needs a stranger be,
Whose every exiled day gone by
  Aches with their memory.

Where is my love--
  In silence and shadow she lies,
Under the April-grey, calm waste of the skies;
    And a bird above,
  In the darkness tender and clear,
Keeps saying over and over, Love lies here!

    Not that she's dead;
  Only her soul is flown
Out of its last pure earthly mansion;
    And cries instead
  In the darkness, tender and clear,
Like the voice of a bird in the leaves, Love--
      Love lies here.

Sweet sounds, begone--
  Whose music on my ear
Stirs foolish discontent
  Or lingering here;
When, if I crossed
  The crystal verge of death,
Him I should see.
  Who these sounds murmureth.

Sweet sounds, begone--
  Ask not my heart to break
Its bond of bravery for
  Sweet quiet's sake;
Lure not my feet
  To leave the path they must
Tread on, unfaltering,
  Till I sleep in dust.

Sweet sounds, begone!
  Though silence brings apace
Deadly disquiet
  Of this homeless place;
And all I love
  In beauty cries to me,
"We but vain shadows
  And reflections be."

Very old are the woods;
  And the buds that break
Out of the brier's boughs,
  When March winds wake,
So old with their beauty are--
  Oh, no man knows
Through what wild centuries
  Roves back the rose.

Very old are the brooks;
  And the rills that rise
Where snow sleeps cold beneath
  The azure skies
Sing such a history
  Of come and gone,
Their every drop is as wise
  As Solomon.

Very old are we men;
  Our dreams are tales
Told in dim Eden
  By Eve's nightingales;
We wake and whisper awhile,
  But, the day gone by,
Silence and sleep like fields
  Of amaranth lie.

When the rose is faded,
  Memory may still dwell on
Her beauty shadowed,
  And the sweet smell gone.

That vanishing loveliness,
  That burdening breath
No bond of life hath then
  Nor grief of death.

'Tis the immortal thought
  Whose passion still
Makes of the changing
  The unchangeable.

Oh, thus thy beauty,
  Loveliest on earth to me,
Dark with no sorrow, shines
  And burns, with Thee.

Men all, and birds, and creeping beasts,
  When the dark of night is deep,
From the moving wonder of their lives
  Commit themselves to sleep.

Without a thought, or fear, they shut
  The narrow gates of sense;
Heedless and quiet, in slumber turn
  Their strength to impotence.

The transient strangeness of the earth
  Their spirits no more see:
Within a silent gloom withdrawn,
  They slumber in secrecy.

Two worlds they have--a globe forgot
  Wheeling from dark to light;
And all the enchanted realm of dream
  That burgeons out of night.

Half-hidden in a graveyard,
  In the blackness of a yew,
Where never living creature stirs,
  Nor sunbeam pierces through,

Is a tomb, green and crooked,--
  Its faded legend gone,--
With but one rain-worn cherub's head
  Of smouldering stone.

There, when the dusk is falling,
  Silence broods so deep
It seems that every wind that breathes
  Blows from the field of sleep.

Day breaks in heedless beauty,
  Kindling each drop of dew,
But unforsaking shadow dwells
  Beneath this lonely yew.

And, all else lost and faded,
  Only this listening head
Keeps with a strange unanswering smile
  Its secret with the dead.

Never more, Sailor,
Shall thou be
Tossed on the wind-ridden,
Restless sea.
Its tides may labour;
All the world
Shake 'neath that weight
Of waters hurled:
But its whole shock
Can only stir
Thy dust to a quiet
Even quieter.
Thou mock'st at land
Who now art come
To such a small
And shallow home;
Yet bore the sea
Full many a care
For bones that once
A sailor's were.
And though the grave's
Deep soundlessness
Thy once sea-deafened
Ear distress,
No robin ever
On the deep
Hopped with his song
To haunt thy sleep.

Far are the shades of Arabia,
  Where the Princes ride at noon,
'Mid the verdurous vales and thickets,
  Under the ghost of the moon;
And so dark is that vaulted purple
  Flowers in the forest rise
And toss into blossom 'gainst the phantom stars
  Pale in the noonday skies.

Sweet is the music of Arabia
  In my heart, when out of dreams
I still in the thin clear mirk of dawn
  Descry her gliding streams;
Hear her strange lutes on the green banks
  Ring loud with the grief and delight
Of the dim-silked dark-haired Musicians
  In the brooding silence of night.

They haunt me--her lutes and her forests;
  No beauty on earth I see
But shadowed with that dreams recalls
  Her loveliness to me:
Still eyes look coldly upon me,
  Cold voices whisper and say--
"He is crazed with the spell of far Arabia,
  They have stolen his wits away."

Still, and blanched, and cold, and lone,
  The icy hills far off from me
With frosty ulys overgrown
  Stand in their sculptured secrecy.

No path of theirs the chamois fleet
  Treads, with a nostril to the wind;
O'er their ice-marbled glaciers beat
  No wings of eagles in my mind--

Yea, in my mind these mountains rise,
  Their perils dyed with evening's rose;
And still my ghost sits at my eyes
  And thirsts for their untroubled snows.

When Queen Djenira slumbers through
  The sultry noon's repose,
From out her dreams, as soft she lies,
  A faint thin music flows.

Her lovely hands lie narrow and pale
  With gilded nails, her head
Couched in its handed nets of gold
  Lies pillowed on her bed.

The little Nubian boys who fan
  Her cheeks and tresses clear,
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful voices
  Seem afar to hear.

They slide their eyes, and nodding, say,
  "Queen Djenira walks to-day
The courts of the lord Pthamasar
  Where the sweet birds of Psuthys are."

And those of earth about her porch
  Of shadow cool and grey
Their sidelong beaks in silence lean,
  And silent flit away.

Down by the waters of the sea
Reigns the King of Never-to-be.
His palace walls are black with night;
His torches star and moon's light,
And for his timepiece deep and grave
Beats on the green unhastening wave.

Windswept are his high corridors;
His pleasance the sea-mantled shores;
For sentinel a shadow stands
With hair in heaven, and cloudy hands;
And round his bed, king's guards to be,
Watch pines in iron solemnity.

His hound is mute; his steed at will
Roams pastures deep with asphodel;
His queen is to her slumber gone;
His courtiers mute lie, hewn in stone;
He hath forgot where he did hide
His sceptre in the mountain-side.

Grey-capped and muttering, mad is he--
The childless King of Never-to-be;
For all his people in the deep
Keep, everlasting, fast asleep;
And all his realm is foam and rain,
Whispering of what comes not again.

In dreams a dark château
  Stands ever open to me,
In far ravines dream-waters flow,
  Descending soundlessly;
Above its peaks the eagle floats,
  Lone in a sunless sky;
Mute are the golden woodland throats
  Of the birds flitting by.

No voice is audible. The wind
  Sleeps in its peace.
No flower of the light can find
  Refuge beneath its trees;
Only the darkening ivy climbs
  Mingled with wilding rose,
And cypress, morn and evening, time's
  Black shadow throws.

All vacant, and unknown;
  Only the dreamer steps
From stone to hollow stone,
  Where the green moss sleeps,
Peers at the rivers in its deeps,
  The eagle lone in the sky,
While the dew of evening drips,
  Coldly and silently.

Would that I could steal in!--
  Into each secret room;
Would that my sleep-bright eyes could win
  To the inner gloom;
Gaze from its high windows,
  Far down its mouldering walls,
Where amber-clear still Lethe flows,
  And foaming falls.

But ever as I gaze,
  From slumber soft doth come
Some touch my stagnant sense to raise
  To its old earthly home;
Fades then that sky serene;
  And peak of ageless snow;
Fades to a paling dawn-lit green,
  My dark château.

Deep in a forest where the kestrel screamed,
  Beside a lake of water, clear as glass,
The time-worn windows of a stone house gleamed
        Named only "Alas."

Yet happy as the wild birds in the glades
  Of that green forest, thridding the still air
With low continued heedless serenades,
        Its heedless people were.

The throbbing chords of violin and lute,
  The lustre of lean tapers in dark eyes,
Fair colours, beauteous flowers, faint-bloomed fruit
        Made earth seem Paradise

To them that dwelt within this lonely house:
  Like children of the gods in lasting peace,
They ate, sang, danced, as if each day's carouse
        Need never pause, nor cease.

Some to the hunt would wend, with hound and horn,
  And clash of silver, beauty, bravery, pride,
Heeding not one who on white horse upborne
        With soundless hoofs did ride.

Dreamers there were who watched the hours away
  Beside a fountain's foam. And in the sweet
Of phantom evening, 'neath the night-bird's lay,
        Did loved with loved-one meet.

All, all were children, for, the long day done,
  They barred the heavy door against lightfoot fear;
And few words spake though one known face was gone,
        Yet still seemed hovering near.

They heaped the bright fire higher; poured dark wine;
  And in long revelry dazed the questioning eye;
Curtained three-fold the heart-dismaying shine
        Of midnight streaming by.

They shut the dark out from the painted wall,
  With candles dared the shadow at the door,
Sang down the faint reiterated call
        Of those who came no more.

Yet clear above that portal plain was writ,
  Confronting each at length alone to pass
Out of its beauty into night star-lit,
        That word "Alas!"

"Is there anybody there?" said the Traveller,
  Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
  Of the forest's ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
  Above the Traveller's head:
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
  "Is there anybody there?" he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
  No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
  Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
  That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
  To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
  That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
  By the lonely Traveller's call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
  Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
  'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
  Louder, and lifted his head:--
"Tell them I came, and no one answered,
  That I kept my word," he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
  Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
  From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
  And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
  When the plunging hoofs were gone.

    There was nought in the Valley
    But a Tower of Ivory,
Its base enwreathed with red
    Flowers that at evening
    Caught the sun's crimson
As to Ocean low he sped.

    Lucent and lovely
    It stood in the morning
Under a trackless hill;
    With snows eternal
    Muffling its summit,
And silence ineffable.

    Sighing of solitude
    Winds from the cold heights
Haunted its yellowing stone;
    At noon its shadow
    Stretched athwart cedars
    Whence every bird was flown.

    Its stair was broken,
    Its starlit walls were
Fretted; its flowers shone
    Wide at the portal,
    Full-blown and fading,
Their last faint fragrance gone.

    And on high in its lantern
    A shape of the living
Watched o'er a shoreless sea,
    From a Tower rotting
    With age and weakness,
    Once lovely as ivory.

An ominous bird sang from its branch,
    "Beware, O Wanderer!
Night 'mid her flowers of glamourie spilled
    Draws swiftly near:

"Night with her darkened caravans,
    Piled deep with silver and myrrh,
Draws from the portals of the East,
    O Wanderer near."

"Night who walks plumèd through the fields
    Of stars that strangely stir--
Smitten to fire by the sandals of him
    Who walks with her."

Heart-sick of his journey was the Wanderer;
  Footsore and parched was he;
And a Witch who long had lurked by the wayside,
  Looked out of sorcery.

"Lift up your eyes, you lonely Wanderer,"
  She peeped from her casement small;
"Here's shelter and quiet to give you rest, young man,
  And apples for thirst withal."

And he looked up out of his sad reverie,
  And saw all the woods in green,
With birds that flitted feathered in the dappling,
  The jewel-bright leaves between.

And he lifted up his face towards her lattice,
  And there, alluring-wise,
Slanting through the silence of the long past,
  Dwelt the still green Witch's eyes.

And vaguely from the hiding-place of memory
  Voices seemed to cry;
"What is the darkness of one brief life-time
  To the deaths thou hast made us die?

"Heed not the words of the Enchantress
  Who would us still betray!"
And sad with the echo of their reproaches,
  Doubting, he turned away.

"I may not shelter beneath your roof, lady,
  Nor in this wood's green shadow seek repose,
Nor will your apples quench the thirst
  A homesick wanderer knows."

"'Homesick' forsooth!" she softly mocked him:
  And the beauty in her face
Made in the sunshine pale and trembling
  A stillness in that place.

And he sighed, as if in fear, that young Wanderer,
  Looking to left and to right,
Where the endless narrow road swept onward,
  Till in distance lost to sight.

And there fell upon his sense the brier,
  Haunting the air with its breath,
And the faint shrill sweetness of the birds' throats,
  Their tent of leaves beneath.

And there was the Witch, in no wise heeding;
  Her arbour, and fruit-filled dish,
Her pitcher of well-water, and clear damask--
  All that the weary wish.

And the last gold beam across the green world
  Faltered and failed, as he
Remembered his solitude and the dark night's
  Inhospitality.

And he looked upon the Witch with eyes of sorrow
  In the darkening of the day;
And turned him aside into oblivion;
  And the voices died away....

And the Witch stepped down from her casement:
  In the hush of night he heard
The calling and wailing in dewy thicket
  Of bird to hidden bird.

And gloom stole all her burning crimson,
  Remote and faint in space
As stars in gathering shadow of the evening
  Seemed now her phantom face.

And one night's rest shall be a myriad,
  Midst dreams that come and go;
Till heedless fate, unmoved by weakness, bring him
  This same strange by-way through:

To the beauty of earth that fades in ashes,
  The lips of welcome, and the eyes
More beauteous than the feeble shine of Hesper
  Lone in the lightening skies:

Till once again the Witch's guile entreat him;
  But, worn with wisdom, he
Steadfast and cold shall choose the dark night's
  Inhospitality.

The rabbit in his burrow keeps
No guarded watch, in peace he sleeps;
The wolf that howls in challenging night
Cowers to her lair at morning light;
The simplest bird entwines a nest
Where she may lean her lovely breast,
Couched in the silence of the bough.
But thou, O man, what rest hast thou?

Thy emptiest solitude can bring
Only a subtler questioning
In thy divided heart. Thy bed
Recalls at dawn what midnight said.
Seek how thou wilt to feign content,
Thy flaming ardour's quickly spent;
Soon thy last company is gone,
And leaves thee--with thyself--alone.

Pomp and great friends may hem thee round,
A thousand busy tasks be found;
Earth's thronging beauties may beguile
Thy longing lovesick heart awhile;
And pride, like clouds of sunset, spread
A changing glory round thy head;
But fade will all; and thou must come,
Hating thy journey, homeless, home.

Rave how thou wilt; unmoved, remote,
That inward presence slumbers not,
Frets out each secret from thy breast,
Gives thee no rally, pause, nor rest,
Scans close thy very thoughts, lest they
Should sap his patient power away,
Answers thy wrath with peace, thy cry
With tenderest taciturnity.

With changeful sound life beats upon the ear;
  Yet, striving for release,
  The most seductive string's
    Sweet jargonings,
    The happiest throat's
  Most easeful, lovely notes
Fall back into a veiling silentness.

Even 'mid the rumour of a moving host,
  Blackening the clear green earth,
  Vainly 'gainst that thin wall
    The trumpets call,
    Or with loud hum
  The smoke-bemuffled drum:
From that high quietness no reply comes forth.

When, all at peace, two friends at ease alone
  Talk out their hearts,--yet still
  Between the grace-notes of
    The voice of love
    From each to each
  Trembles a rarer speech,
And with its presence every pause doth fill.

Unmoved it broods, this all-encompassing hush
  Of one who stooping near,
  No smallest stir will make
    Our fear to wake;
    But yet intent
  Upon some mystery bent
  Harkens the lightest word we say, or hear.

Dark frost was in the air without,
  The dusk was still with cold and gloom,
When less than even a shadow came
    And stood within the room.

But of the three around the fire,
  None turned a questioning head to look,
Still read a clear voice, on and on,
    Still stooped they o'er their book.

The children watched their mother's eyes
  Moving on softly line to line;
It seemed to listen too--that shade,
    Yet made no outward sign.

The fire-flames crooned a tiny song,
  No cold wind moved the wintry tree;
The children both in Faërie dreamed
    Beside their mother's knee.

And nearer yet that spirit drew
  Above that heedless one, intent
Only on what the simple words
    Of her small story meant.

No voiceless sorrow grieved her mind,
  No memory her bosom stirred,
Nor dreamed she, as she read to two,
    'Twas surely three who heard.

Yet when, the story done, she smiled
  From face to face, serene and clear,
A love, half dread, sprang up, as she
    Leaned close and drew them near.

      Peace in thy hands,
      Peace in thine eyes,
      Peace on thy brow;
Flower of a moment in the eternal hour,
      Peace with me now.

      Not a wave breaks,
      Not a bird calls,
      My heart, like a sea,
Silent after a storm that hath died,
      Sleeps within me.

      All the night's dews,
      All the world's leaves,
      All winter's snow
Seem with their quiet to have stilled in life's dream
      All sorrowing now.

Here lies a most beautiful lady,
Light of step and heart was she;
I think she was the most beautiful lady
That ever was in the West Country.
But beauty vanishes; beauty passes;
However rare--rare it be;
And when I crumble, who will remember
This lady of the West Country?

The flowers of the field
  Have a sweet smell;
Meadowsweet, tansy, thyme,
  And faint-heart pimpernel;
But sweeter even than these,
  The silver of the may
Wreathed is with incense for
  The Judgment Day.

An apple, a child, dust,
  When falls the evening rain,
Wild brier's spicèd leaves,
  Breathe memories again;
With further memory fraught,
  The silver of the may
Wreathed is with incense for
  The Judgment Day.

Eyes of all loveliness--
  Shadow of strange delight,
Even as a flower fades
  Must thou from sight;
But oh, o'er thy grave's mound,
  Till come the Judgment Day,
Wreathed shall with incense he
  Thy sharp-thorned may.

When I go free,
I think 'twill be
A night of stars and snow,
And the wild fires of frost shall light
My footsteps as I go;
Nobody--nobody will be there
With groping touch, or sight,
To see me in my bush of hair
Dance burning through the night.

Upon this leafy bush
  With thorns and roses in it,
Flutters a thing of light,
  A twittering linnet.
And all the throbbing world
  Of dew and sun and air
By this small parcel of life
  Is made more fair;
As if each bramble-spray
And mounded gold-wreathed furze,
  Harebell and little thyme,
  Were only hers;
As if this beauty and grace
  Did to one bird belong,
And, at a flutter of wing,
  Might vanish in song.

Speak not--whisper not;
Here bloweth thyme and bergamot;
Softly on the evening hour,
Secret herbs their spices shower.
Dark-spiked rosemary and myrrh,
Lean-stalked, purple lavender;
Hides within her bosom, too,
All her sorrows, bitter rue.

Breathe not--trespass not;
Of this green and darkling spot,
Latticed from the moon's beams,
Perchance a distant dreamer dreams;
Perchance upon its darkening air,
The unseen ghosts of children fare,
Faintly swinging, sway and sweep,
Like lovely sea-flowers in its deep;
While, unmoved, to watch and ward,
Amid its gloomed and daisied sward,
Stands with bowed and dewy head
That one little leaden Lad.

"Thou solitary!" the Blackbird cried,
"I, from the happy Wren,
Linnet and Blackcap, Woodlark, Thrush,
Perched all upon a sweetbrier bush,
Have come at cold of midnight-tide
To ask thee, Why and when
Grief smote thy heart so thou dost sing
In solemn hush of evening,
So sorrowfully, lovelorn Thing--
Nay, nay, not sing, but rave, but wail,
Most melancholic Nightingale?
Do not the dews of darkness steep
All pinings of the day in sleep?
Why, then, when rocked in starry nest
We mutely couch, secure, at rest,
Doth thy lone heart delight to make
Music for sorrow's sake?"
A Moon was there. So still her beam,
It seemed the whole world lay in dream,
Lulled by the watery sea.
And from her leafy night-hung nook
Upon this stranger soft did look
The Nightingale: sighed he:--

"'Tis strange, my friend; the Kingfisher
But yestermorn conjured me here
Out of his green and gold to say
Why thou, in splendour of the noon,
Wearest of colour but golden shoon,
And else dost thee array
In a most sombre suit of black?
'Surely,' he sighed, 'some load of grief,
Past all our thinking--and belief--
Must weigh upon his back!'
Do, then, in turn, tell me, If joy
Thy heart as well as voice employ
Why dost thou now most Sable, shine
In plumage woefuller far than mine?
Thy silence is a sadder thing
Than any dirge I sing!"

Thus, then, these two small birds, perched there,
Breathed a strange riddle both did share
Yet neither could expound.
And we--who sing but as we can,
In the small knowledge of a man--
Have we an answer found?
Nay, some are happy whose delight
Is hid even from themselves from sight;
And some win peace who spend
The skill of words to sweeten despair
Of finding consolation where
Life has but one dark end;
Who, in rapt solitude, tell o'er
A tale as lovely as forlore,
Into the midnight air.

The far moon maketh lovers wise
  In her pale beauty trembling down,
Lending curved cheeks, dark lips, dark eyes,
  A strangeness not her own.
And, though they shut their lids to kiss,
  In starless darkness peace to win,
Even on that secret world from this
  Her twilight enters in.

"I have no master," said the Blind Boy,
  "My mother, 'Dame Venus' they do call;
Cowled in this hood she sent me begging
  For whate'er in pity may befall.

"Hard was her visage, me adjuring,--
  'Have no fond mercy on the kind!
Here be sharp arrows, bunched in quiver,
  Draw close ere striking--thou art blind.'

"So stand I here, my woes entreating,
  In this dark alley, lest the Moon
Point with her sparkling my barbed armoury
  Shine on my silver-lacèd shoon.

"Oh, sir, unkind this Dame to me-ward;
  Of the salt billow was her birth ...
In your sweet charity draw nearer
  The saddest rogue on Earth!"

You hunted me with all the pack,
  Too blind, too blind, to see
By no wild hope of force or greed
  Could you make sure of me.

And like a phantom through the glades,
  With tender breast aglow,
The goddess in me laughed to hear
  Your horns a-roving go.

She laughed to think no mortal ever
  By dint of mortal flesh
The very Cause that was the Hunt
  One moment could enmesh:

That though with captive limbs I lay,
  Stilled breath and vanquished eyes,
He that hunts Love with horse and hound
  Hunts out his heart and eyes.

"Step very softly, sweet Quiet-foot,
Stumble not, whisper not, smile not:
By this dark ivy stoop cheek and brow.
Still even thy heart! What seest thou?..."

"High-coifed, broad-browed, aged, suave yet grim,
A large flat face, eyes keenly dim,
Staring at nothing--that's me!--and yet,
With a hate one could never, no, never forget ..."

"This is my world, my garden, my home,
Hither my father bade mother to come
And bear me out of the dark into light,
And happy I was in her tender sight.

"And then, thou frail flower, she died and went,
Forgetting my pitiless banishment,
And that Old Woman--an Aunt--she said,
Came hither, lodged, fattened, and made her bed.

"Oh yes, thou most blessed, from Monday to Sunday,
Has lived on me, preyed on me, Mrs. Grundy:
Called me, 'dear Nephew'; on each of those chairs
Has gloated in righteousness, heard my prayers.

"Why didst thou dare the thorns of the grove,
Timidest trespasser, huntress of love?
Now thou hast peeped, and now dost know
What kind of creature is thine for foe.

"Not that she'll tear out thy innocent eyes,
Poison thy mouth with deviltries.
Watch thou, wait thou: soon will begin
The guile of a voice: hark!..." "Come in, Come in!"

Flee into some forgotten night and be
Of all dark long my moon-bright company:
Beyond the rumour even of Paradise come,
There, out of all remembrance, make our home:
Seek we some close hid shadow for our lair,
Hollowed by Noah's mouse beneath the chair
Wherein the Omnipotent, in slumber bound,
Nods till the piteous Trump of Judgment sound.
Perchance Leviathan of the deep sea
Would lease a lost mermaiden's grot to me,
There of your beauty we would joyance make--
A music wistful for the sea-nymph's sake:
Haply Elijah, o'er his spokes of fire,
Cresting steep Leo, or the heavenly Lyre,
Spied, tranced in azure of inanest space,
Some eyrie hostel, meet for human grace,
Where two might happy be--just you and I--
Lost in the uttermost of Eternity.
Think! In Time's smallest clock's minutest beat
Might there not rest be found for wandering feet?
Or, 'twixt the sleep and wake of Helen's dream,
Silence wherein to sing love's requiem?
No, no. Nor earth, nor air, nor fire, nor deep
Could lull poor mortal longingness asleep.
Somewhere there Nothing is; and there lost Man
Shall win what changeless vague of peace he can.

The abode of the nightingale is bare,
Flowered frost congeals in the gelid air,
The fox howls from his frozen lair:
      Alas, my loved one is gone,
      I am alone:
      It is winter.

Once the pink cast a winy smell,
The wild bee hung in the hyacinth bell,
Light in effulgence of beauty fell:
      Alas, my loved one is gone,
      I am alone:
      It is winter.

My candle a silent fire doth shed,
Starry Orion hunts o'erhead;
Come moth, come shadow, the world is dead:
      Alas, my loved one is gone,
      I am alone:
      It is winter.

See this house, how dark it is
Beneath its vast-boughed trees!
Not one trembling leaflet cries
To that Watcher in the skies--
"Remove, remove thy searching gaze,
Innocent, of heaven's ways,
Brood not, Moon, so wildly bright,
On secrets hidden from sight."

"Secrets," sighs the night-wind,
"Vacancy is all I find;
Every keyhole I have made
Wails a summons, faint and sad,
No voice ever answers me,
      Only vacancy."
"Once, once ..." the cricket shrills,
And far and near the quiet fills
With its tiny voice, and then
      Hush falls again.

Mute shadows creeping slow
Mark how the hours go.
Every stone is mouldering slow.
And the least winds that blow
Some minutest atom shake,
Some fretting ruin make
In roof and walls. How black it is
Beneath these thick-boughed trees!

"Whom seek you here, sweet Mistress Fell?"
"One who loved me passing well.
Dark his eye, wild his face--
Stranger, if in this lonely place
Bide such an one, then, prythee, say
I am come here to-day."

"Many his like, Mistress Fell?"
"I did not look, so cannot tell.
Only this I surely know,
When his voice called me, I must go;
Touched me his fingers, and my heart
Leapt at the sweet pain's smart."

"Why did he leave you, Mistress Fell?"
"Magic laid its dreary spell.--
Stranger, he was fast asleep;
Into his dream I tried to creep;
Called his name, soft was my cry;
He answered--not one sigh.

"The flower and the thorn are here;
Falleth the night-dew, cold and clear;
Out of her bower the bird replies,
Mocking the dark with ecstasies,
See how the earth's green grass doth grow,
Praising what sleeps below!

"Thus have they told me. And I come,
As flies the wounded wild-bird home.
Not tears I give; but all that he
Clasped in his arms, sweet charity;
All that he loved--to him I bring
For a close whispering."

"Who knocks?" "I, who was beautiful,
  Beyond all dreams to restore,
I, from the roots of the dark thorn am hither.
  And knock on the door."

"Who speaks?" "I--once was my speech
  Sweet as the bird's on the air,
When echo lurks by the waters to heed;
  'Tis I speak thee fair."

"Dark is the hour!" "Ay, and cold."
  "Lone is my house." "Ah, but mine?"
"Sight, touch, lips, eyes yearned in vain."
  "Long dead these to thine ..."

Silence. Still faint on the porch
  Brake the flames of the stars.
In gloom groped a hope-wearied hand
  Over keys, bolts, and bars.

A face peered. All the grey night
  In chaos of vacancy shone;
Nought but vast sorrow was there--
  The sweet cheat gone.

In the woods as I did walk,
  Dappled with the moon's beam,
I did with a Stranger talk,
  And his name was Dream.

Spurred his heel, dark his cloak,
  Shady-wide his bonnet's brim;
His horse beneath a silvery oak
  Grazed as I talked with him.

Softly his breast-brooch burned and shone;
  Hill and deep were in his eyes;
One of his hands held mine, and one
  The fruit that makes men wise.

Wondrously strange was earth to see,
  Flowers white as milk did gleam;
Spread to Heaven the Assyrian Tree,
  Over my head with Dream.

Dews were still betwixt us twain;
  Stars a trembling beauty shed;
Yet--not a whisper comes again
  Of the words he said.

She will not die, they say,
She will but put her beauty by
        And hie away.

Oh, but her beauty gone, how lonely
Then will seem all reverie,
        How black to me!

All things will sad be made
And every hope a memory,
        All gladness dead.

Ghosts of the past will know
My weakest hour, and whisper to me,
        And coldly go.

And hers in deep of sleep,
Clothed in its mortal beauty I shall see,
        And, waking, weep.

Naught will my mind then find
In man's false Heaven my peace to be:
        All blind, and blind.

Why did you flutter in vain hope, poor bird,
  Hard-pressed in your small cage of clay?
'Twas but a sweet, false echo that you heard,
      Caught only a feint of day.

Still is the night all dark, a homeless dark.
  Burn yet the unanswering stars. And silence brings
The same sea's desolate surge--sans bound or mark--
      Of all your wanderings.

Fret now no more; be still. Those steadfast eyes,
  Those folded hands, they cannot set you free;
Only with beauty wake wild memories--
  Sorrow for where you are, for where you would be.

O all ye fair ladies with your colours and your graces,
  And your eyes clear in flame of candle and hearth,
Toward the dark of this old window lift not up your smiling faces,
  Where a Shade stands forlorn from the cold of the earth.

God knows I could not rest for one I still was thinking of;
  Like a rose sheathed in beauty her spirit was to me;
Now out of unforgottenness a bitter draught I'm drinking of,
  'Tis sad of such beauty unremembered to be.

Men all all shades, O Woman.--Winds wist not of the way they blow.
  Apart from your kindness, life's at best but a snare.
Though a tongue now past praise this bitter thing doth say, I know
  What solitude means, and how, homeless, I fare.

Strange, strange, are ye all--except in beauty shared with her--
  Since I seek one I loved, yet was faithless to in death.
Not life enough I heaped, so thus my heart must fare with her,
  Now wrapt in the gross clay, bereft of life's breath.

When music sounds, gone is the earth I know,
And all her lovely things even lovelier grow;
Her flowers in vision flame, her forest trees,
Lift burdened branches, stilled with ecstasies.

When music sounds, out of the water rise
Naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes,
Rapt in strange dreams burns each enchanted face,
With solemn echoing stirs their dwelling-place.

When music sounds, all that I was I am
Ere to this haunt of brooding dust I came;
While from Time's woods break into distant song
The swift-winged hours, as I hasten along.

I was at peace until you came
And set a careless mind aflame.
I lived in quiet; cold, content;
All longing in safe banishment,
Until your ghostly lips and eyes
    Made wisdom unwise.

Naught was in me to tempt your feet
To seek a lodging. Quite forgot
Lay the sweet solitude we two
In childhood used to wander through;
Time's cold had closed my heart about;
    And shut you out.

Well, and what then?... O vision grave,
Take all the little all I have!
Strip me of what in voiceless thought
Life's kept of life, unhoped, unsought!--
Reverie and dream that memory must
    Hide deep in dust!

This only I say:--Though cold and bare
The haunted house you have chosen to share,
Still 'neath its walls the moonbeam goes
    And trembles on the untended rose;

Still o'er its broken roof-tree rise
The starry arches of the skies;
And in your lightest word shall be
    The thunder of an ebbing sea.

'Tis not my voice now speaks; but a bird
In darkling forest hollows a sweet throat--
Pleads on till distant echo too hath heard
    And doubles every note:
So love that shrouded dwells in mystery
    Would cry and waken thee.

Thou Solitary, stir in thy still sleep;
All the night waits thee, yet thou still dream'st on.
Furtive the shadows that about thee creep,
And cheat the shining footsteps of the moon:
Unseal thine eyes, it is my heart that sings,
    And beats in vain its wings.

Lost in heaven's vague, the stars burn softly through
The world's dark latticings, we prisoned stray
Within its lovely labyrinth, and know
    Mute seraphs guard the way
Even from silence unto speech, from love
To that self's self it still is dreaming of.

I am that Adam who, with Snake for guest,
Hid anguished eyes upon Eve's piteous breast.
I am that Adam who, with broken wings,
Fled from the Seraph's brazen trumpetings.
Betrayed and fugitive, I still must roam
A world where sin, and beauty, whisper of Home.

Oh, from wide circuit, shall at length I see
Pure daybreak lighten again on Eden's tree?
Loosed from remorse and hope and love's distress,
Enrobe me again in my lost nakedness?
No more with wordless grief a loved one grieve,
But to Heaven's nothingness re-welcome Eve?

After the songless rose of evening,
    Night quiet, dark, still,
In nodding cavalcade advancing
    Starred the deep hill:
You, in the valley standing,
    In your quiet wonder took
All that glamour, peace, and mystery
    In one grave look.
Beauty hid your naked body,
    Time dreamed in your bright hair,
In your eyes the constellations
    Burned far and fair.

The burning fire shakes in the night,
  On high her silver candles gleam,
With far-flung arms enflamed with light,
  The trees are lost in dream.

Come in thy beauty! 'tis my love,
  Lost in far-wandering desire,
Hath in the darkling deep above
  Set stars and kindled fire.

O strange devices that alone divide
The seër from the seen--
The very highway of earth's pomp and pride
That lies between
The traveller and the cheating, sweet delight
Of where he longs to be,
But which, bound hand and foot, he, close on night,
Can only see.

Hearken, O dear, now strikes the hour we die;
We, who in our strange kiss
Have proved a dream the world's realities,
Turned each from other's darkness with a sigh,
Need heed no more of life, waste no more breath
On any other journey, but of death.

And yet: Oh, know we well
How each of us must prove Love's infidel;
Still out of ecstasy turn trembling back
To earth's same empty track
Of leaden day by day, and hour by hour, and be
Of all things lovely the cold mortuary.

Why in my heart, O Grief,
Dost thou in beauty hide?
Dead is my well-content,
And buried deep my pride.
Cold are their stones, beloved,
To hand and side.

The shadows of even are gone,
Shut are the day's clear flowers,
Now have her birds left mute
Their singing bowers,
Lone shall we be, we twain,
In the night hours.

Thou with thy cheek on mine,
And dark hair loosed, shall see
Take the far stars for fruit
The cypress tree,
And in the yew's black
Shall the moon be.

We will tell no old tales,
Nor heed if in wandering air
Die a lost song of love
Or the once fair;
Still as well-water be
The thoughts we share!

And, while the ghosts keep
Tryst from chill sepulchres,
Dreamless our gaze shall sleep,
And sealed our ears;
Heart unto heart will speak,
Without tears.

O, thy veiled, lovely face--
Joy's strange disguise--
Shall be the last to fade
From these rapt eyes,
Ere the first dart of daybreak
Pierce the skies.

What needest thou?--a few brief hours of rest
Wherein to seek thyself in thine own breast;
A transient silence wherein truth could say
Such was thy constant hope, and this thy way?--
      O burden of life that is
      A livelong tangle of perplexities!

What seekest thou?--a truce from that thou art;
Some steadfast refuge from a fickle heart;
Still to be thou, and yet no thing of scorn,
To find no stay here, and yet not forlorn?--
      O riddle of life that is
      An endless war 'twixt contrarieties.

Leave this vain questioning. Is not sweet the rose?
Sings not the wild bird ere to rest he goes?
Hath not in miracle brave June returned?
Burns not her beauty as of old it burned?
      O foolish one to roam
      So far in thine own mind away from home!

Where blooms the flower when her petals fade,
Where sleepeth echo by earth's music made,
Where all things transient to the changeless win,
There waits the peace thy spirit dwelleth in.

Dark is the night,
  The fire burns faint and low,
Hours--days--years,
  Into grey ashes go;
I strive to read,
  But sombre is the glow.

Thumbed are the pages,
  And the print is small;
Mocking the winds
  That from the darkness call;
Feeble the fire that lends
  Its light withal.

O ghost, draw nearer;
  Let thy shadowy hair,
Blot out the pages
  That we cannot share;
Be ours the one last leaf
  By Fate left bare!

Let's Finis scrawl,
  And then Life's book put by;
Turn each to each
  In all simplicity:
Ere the last flame is gone
  To warm us by.

Old and alone, sit we,
  Caged, riddle-rid men;
Lost to Earth's "Listen!" and "See!"
  Thought's "Wherefore?" and "When?"

Only far memories stray
  Of a past once lovely, but now
Wasted and faded away,
  Like green leaves from the bough.

Vast broods the silence of night,
  The ruinous moon
Lifts on our faces her light,
  Whence all dreaming is gone.

We speak not; trembles each head;
  In their sockets our eyes are still;
Desire as cold as the dead;
  Without wonder or will.
And One, with a lanthorn, draws near,
  At clash with the moon in our eyes:
"Where art thou?" he asks: "I am here,"
  One by one we arise.

And none lifts a hand to withhold
  A friend from the touch of that foe:
Heart cries unto heart, "Thou art old!"
  Yet, reluctant, we go.

O thou who giving helm and sword,
  Gav'st, too, the rusting rain,
And starry dark's all tender dews
    To blunt and stain:

Out of the battle I am sped,
  Unharmed, yet stricken sore;
A living shape amid whispering shades
    On Lethe's shore.

No trophy in my hands I bring,
  To this sad, sighing stream,
The neighings and the trumps and cries
    Were but a dream.

Traitor to life, of life betrayed:
  O, of thy mercy deep,
A dream my all, the all I ask
    Is sleep.

Come, Death, I'd have a word with thee;
And thou, poor Innocency;
And love--a Lad with broken wing;
And Pity, too:
The Fool shall sing to you,
As Fools will sing.

Ay, music hath small sense,
And a tune's soon told,
And Earth is old,
And my poor wits are dense;
Yet have I secrets,--dark, my dear,
To breathe you all: Come near.
And lest some hideous listener tells,
I'll ring my bells.

They are all at war!--
Yes, yes, their bodies go
'Neath burning sun and icy star
To chaunted songs of woe,
Dragging cold cannon through a mire
Of rain and blood and spouting fire,
The new moon glinting hard on eyes
Wide with insanities!

Hush!... I use words
I hardly know the meaning of;
And the mute birds
Are glancing at Love
From out their shade of leaf and flower,
Trembling at treacheries
Which even in noonday cower.
Heed, heed not what I said
Of frenzied hosts of men,
More fools than I,
On envy, hatred fed,
Who kill, and die--
Spake I not plainly, then?
Yet Pity whispered, "Why?"

Thou silly thing, off to thy daisies go.
Mine was not news for child to know,
And Death--no ears hath. He hath supped where creep
Eyeless worms in hush of sleep;
Yet, when he smiles, the hand he draws
Athwart his grinning jaws--
Faintly the thin bones rattle, and--There, there;
Hearken how my bells in the air
Drive away care!...

Nay, but a dream I had
Of a world all mad.
Not simply happy mad like me,
Who am mad like an empty scene
Of water and willow tree,
Where the wind hath been;
But that foul Satan-mad,
Who rots in his own head,
And counts the dead,
Not honest one--and two--
But for the ghosts they were,
Brave, faithful, true,
When, head in air,
In Earth's clear green and blue
Heaven they did share
With beauty who bade them there ...
There, now! Death goes--
Mayhap I've wearied him.
Ay, and the light doth dim,
And asleep's the rose,
And tired Innocence
In dreams is hence ...
Come, Love, my lad,
Nodding that drowsy head,
'Tis time thy prayers were said!

Let the foul Scene proceed:
  There's laughter in the wings;
'Tis sawdust that they bleed,
  But a box Death brings.

How rare a skill is theirs
  These extreme pangs to show,
How real a frenzy wears
  Each feigner of woe!

Gigantic dins uprise!
  Even the gods must feel
A smarting of the eyes
  As these fumes upsweal.

Strange, such a Piece is free,
  While we Spectators sit,
Aghast at its agony,
  Yet absorbed in it!

Dark is the outer air,
  Cold the night draughts blow
Mutely we stare, and stare
  At the frenzied Show.

Yet heaven hath its quiet shroud
  Of deep, immutable blue--
We cry "An end!" We are bowed
  By the dread, "'Tis true!"

While the Shape who hoofs applause
  Behind our deafened ear,
Hoots--angel-wise--"the Cause!"
  And affright even fear.

You sleep too well--too far away,
  For sorrowing word to soothe or wound;
Your very quiet seems to say
  How longed-for a peace you have found.

Else, had not death so lured you on,
  You would have grieved--'twixt joy and fear--
To know how my small loving son
  Had wept for you, my dear.
Roses are sweet to smell and see,
  And lilies on the stem;
But rarer, stranger buds there be,
  And she was like to them.

The little moon that April brings,
  More lovely shade than light,
That, setting, silvers lonely hills
  Upon the verge of night--

Close to the world of my poor heart
  So stole she, still and clear;
Now that she's gone, O dark, and dark,
  The solitude, the fear.

    Never, no never, listen too long,
To the chattering wind in the willow, the night bird's song.

    'Tis sad in sooth to lie under the grass,
But none too gladsome to wake and grow cold where life's shadows pass.

    Dumb the old Toll-Woman squats,
And, for every green copper battered and worn, doles out Nevers and Nots.

    I know a Blind Man, too,
Who with a sharp ear listens and listens the whole world through.

    Oh, sit we snug to our feast,
With platter and finger and spoon--and good victuals at least.

Clear eyes do dim at last,
  And cheeks outlive their rose.
Time, heedless of the past,
  No loving-kindness knows;
Chill unto mortal lip
    Still Lethe flows.

Griefs, too, but brief while stay,
  And sorrow, being o'er,
Its salt tears shed away,
  Woundeth the heart no more.
Stealthily lave those waters
    That solemn shore.

Ah, then, sweet face burn on,
  While yet quick memory lives!
And Sorrow, ere thou art gone,
  Know that my heart forgives--
Ere yet, grown cold in peace,
    It loves not, nor grieves.

Heavenly Archer, bend thy bow;
Now the flame of life burns low,
Youth is gone; I, too, would go.

Even Fortune leads to this:
Harsh or kind, at last she is
Murderess of all ecstasies.

Yet the spirit, dark, alone,
Bound in sense, still hearkens on
For tidings of a bliss foregone.

Sleep is well for dreamless head,
At no breath astonishèd,
From the Gardens of the Dead.

I the immortal harps hear ring,
By Babylon's river languishing.
Heavenly Archer, loose thy string.

Far are those tranquil hills,
  Dyed with fair evening's rose;
On urgent, secret errand bent,
    A traveller goes.

Approach him strangers three,
  Barefooted, cowled; their eyes
Scan the lone, hastening solitary
    With dumb surmise.

One instant in close speech
  With them he doth confer:
God-sped, he hasteneth on,
    That anxious traveller ...

I was that man--in a dream:
  And each world's night in vain
I patient wait on sleep to unveil
    Those vivid hills again.

Would that they three could know
  How yet burns on in me
Love--from one lost in Paradise--
    For their grave courtesy.

It was the Great Alexander,
  Capped with a golden helm,
Sate in the ages, in his floating ship,
    In a dead calm.

Voices of sea-maids singing
  Wandered across the deep:
The sailors labouring on their oars
    Rowed, as in sleep.

All the high pomp of Asia,
  Charmed by that siren lay,
Out of their weary and dreaming minds,
    Faded away.

Like a bold boy sate their Captain,
  His glamour withered and gone,
In the souls of his brooding mariners,
    While the song pined on.

Time, like a falling dew,
  Life, like the scene of a dream,
Laid between slumber and slumber,
    Only did seem....

O Alexander, then,
  In all us mortals too,
Wax thou not bold--too bold
    On the wave dark-blue!

Come the calm, infinite night,
  Who then will hear
Aught save the singing
    Of the sea-maids clear?

Green in light are the hills, and a calm wind flowing
  Filleth the void with a flood of the fragrance of Spring;
Wings in this mansion of life are coming and going,
  Voices of unseen loveliness carol and sing.

Coloured with buds of delight the boughs are swaying,
  Beauty walks in the woods, and wherever she rove
Flowers from wintry sleep, her enchantment obeying,
  Stir in the deep of her dream, reawaken to love.

Oh, now begone sullen care--this light is my seeing;
  I am the palace, and mine are its windows and walls;
Daybreak is come, and life from the darkness of being
  Springs, like a child from the womb, when the lonely one calls.

As I did walk in meadows green
  I heard the summer noon resound
With call of myriad things unseen
  That leapt and crept upon the ground.

High overhead the windless air
  Throbbed with the homesick coursing cry
Of swallows that did everywhere
  Wake echo in the sky.

Beside me, too, clear waters coursed
  Which willow branches, lapsing low,
Breaking their crystal gliding forced
  To sing as they did flow.

I listened; and my heart was dumb
  With praise no language could express;
Longing in vain for him to come
  Who had breathed such blessedness

On this fair world, wherein we pass
  So chequered and so brief a stay;
And yearned in spirit to learn, alas,
  What kept him still away.

How do the days press on, and lay
  Their fallen locks at evening down,
Whileas the stars in darkness play
    And moonbeams weave a crown--

A crown of flower-like light in heaven,
  Where in the hollow arch of space
Morn's mistress dreams, and the Pleiads seven
    Stand watch about her place.

Stand watch--O days no number keep
  Of hours when this dark clay is blind.
When the world's clocks are dumb in sleep
    'Tis then I seek my kind.

For all the grief I have given with words
  May now a few clear flowers blow,
In the dust, and the heat, and the silence of birds,
        Where the lonely go.

For the thing unsaid that heart asked of me
  Be a dark, cool water calling--calling
To the footsore, benighted, solitary,
        When the shadows are falling.

O, be beauty for all my blindness,
  A moon in the air where the weary wend,
And dews burdened with loving-kindness
        In the dark of the end.

What lovely things
  Thy hand hath made:
The smooth-plumed bird
  In its emerald shade,
The seed of the grass,
  The speck of stone
Which the wayfaring ant
  Stirs--and hastes on!

Though I should sit
  By some tarn in thy hills,
Using its ink
  As the spirit wills
To write of Earth's wonders,
  Its live, willed things,
Flit would the ages
  On soundless wings.
Ere unto Z
  My pen drew nigh;
Leviathan told,
  And the honey-fly:
And still would remain
  My wit to try
My worn reeds broken,
  The dark tarn dry,
All words forgotten--
  Thou, Lord, and I.

When I lie where shades of darkness
Shall no more assail mine eyes,
Nor the rain make lamentation
    When the wind sighs;
How will fare the world whose wonder
Was the very proof of me?
Memory fades, must the remembered
    Perishing be?

Oh, when this my dust surrenders
Hand, foot, lip, to dust again,
May these loved and loving faces
    Please other men!
May the rustling harvest hedgerow
Still the Traveller's Joy entwine,
And as happy children gather
    Posies once mine.

Look thy last on all things lovely,
Every hour. Let no night
Seal thy sense in deathly slumber
    Till to delight
Thou have paid thy utmost blessing;
Since that all things thou wouldst praise
Beauty took from those who loved them
    In other days.

As I lay awake in the white moonlight,
I heard a faint singing in the wood,
      "Out of bed,
      Sleepyhead,
    Put your white foot, now;
      Here are we
      Beneath the tree
    Singing round the root now."

I looked out of window, in the white moonlight,
The leaves were like snow in the wood--
      "Come away,
      Child, and play
    Light with the gnomies;
      In a mound,
      Green and round,
    That's where their home is."

      "Honey sweet,
      Curds to eat,
    Cream and frumenty,
      Shells and beads,
      Poppy seeds,
    You shall have plenty."

But, as soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight
  To put on my stocking and my shoe,
The sweet shrill singing echoed faintly away,
  And the grey of the morning peeped through,
And instead of the gnomies there came a red robin
  To sing of the buttercups and dew.

Where the bluebells and the wind are,
    Fairies in a ring I spied,
And I heard a little linnet
    Singing near beside.

Where the primrose and the dew are--
    Soon were sped the fairies all:
Only now the green turf freshens,
    And the linnets call.

I watched the Lady Caroline
Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;
Her face was rosy in the glass,
And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,
    White in the candleshine.

Her bottles on the table lay,
Stoppered, yet sweet of violet;
Her image in the mirror stooped
To view those locks as lightly looped
    As cherry boughs in May.

The snowy night lay dim without,
I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;
The window smouldered keen with frost;
Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed
    Her beauteous hair about.

If I were Lord of Tartary,
  Myself and me alone,
My bed should be of ivory,
  Of beaten gold my throne;
And in my court would peacocks flaunt,
And in my forests tigers haunt,
And in my pools great fishes slant
  Their fins athwart the sun.

If I were Lord of Tartary,
  Trumpeters every day
To every meal should summon me,
  And in my courtyard bray;
And in the evening lamps would shine,
Yellow as honey, red as wine,
While harp, and flute, and mandoline,
  Made music sweet and gay.

If I were Lord of Tartary,
  I'd wear a robe of beads,
White, and gold, and green they'd be--
  And clustered thick as seeds;
And ere should wane the morning-star,
I'd don my robe and scimitar,
And zebras seven should draw my car
  Through Tartary's dark glades.

Lord of the fruits of Tartary,
  Her rivers silver-pale!
Lord of the hills of Tartary,
  Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!
Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,
Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,
Her bird-delighting citron-trees
  In every purple vale!

I had a silver buckle,
  I sewed it on my shoe,
And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe
  I danced the evening through.

I had a bunch of cowslips,
  I hid them in a grot,
In case the elves should come by night
  And me remember not.

I had a yellow riband,
  I tied it in my hair,
That, walking in the garden,
  The birds might see it there.

I had a secret laughter,
  I laughed it near the wall:
Only the ivy and the wind
  May tell of it at all.

In the black furrow of a field
  I saw an old witch-hare this night;
And she cocked a lissome ear,
  And she eyed the moon so bright,
And she nibbled of the green;
  And I whispered "Wh-s-st! witch-hare,"
Away like a ghostie o'er the field
  She fled, and left the moonlight there.

"Bunches of grapes," says Timothy;
"Pomegranates pink," says Elaine;
"A junket of cream and a cranberry tart
    For me," says Jane.

"Love-in-a-mist," says Timothy;
"Primroses pale," says Elaine;
"A nosegay of pinks and mignonette
    For me," says Jane.

"Chariots of gold," says Timothy;
"Silvery wings," says Elaine;
"A bumpity ride in a waggon of hay
    For me," says Jane.

I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
  Deep down twenty steps of stone;
In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
    Smiling there alone.

He read no book, he snuffed no candle;
  The rats ran in, the rats ran out;
And far and near, the drip of water
    Went whispering about.

The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,
  I saw the Dog Star bleak and grim,
I saw a slim brown rat of Norway
    Creep over him.

I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
  Deep down twenty steps of stone;
In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
    Smiling there alone.

How large unto the tiny fly
  Must little things appear!--
A rosebud like a feather bed,
  Its prickle like a spear;

A dewdrop like a looking-glass,
  A hair like golden wire;
The smallest grain of mustard-seed
  As fierce as coals of fire;

A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;
  A wasp, a cruel leopard;
And specks of salt as bright to see
  As lambkins to a shepherd.

O for a moon to light me home!
  O for a lanthorn green!
For those sweet stars the Pleiades,
That glitter in the darkling trees;
  O for a lovelorn taper! O
  For a lanthorn green!

O for a frock of tartan!
  O for clear, wild grey eyes!
For fingers light as violets,
'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;
  O for a thistly meadow! O
  For clear, wild grey eyes!

O for a heart like almond boughs!
  O for sweet thoughts like rain!
O for first-love like fields of grey
Shut April-buds at break of day!
  O for a sleep like music!
  Dreams still as rain!

    I saw three witches
    That bowed down like barley,
And straddled their brooms 'neath a louring sky,
    And, mounting a storm-cloud,
    Aloft on its margin,
Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.

    I saw three witches
    That mocked the poor sparrows
They carried in cages of wicker along,
    Till a hawk from his eyrie
    Swooped down like an arrow,
Smote on the cages, and ended their song.

    I saw three witches
    That sailed in a shallop,
All turning their heads with a snickering smile,
    Till a bank of green osiers
    Concealed their grim faces,
Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.

    I saw three witches
    Asleep in a valley,
Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,
    Till the moon, creeping upward,
    Looked white through the valley,
And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.

"Sailorman, I'll give to you
  My bright silver penny,
If out to sea you'll sail me
  And my dear sister Jenny."

"Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye
  And your dear sister Jenny,
But pay she shall her golden locks
  Instead of your penny."

They sail away, they sail away,
  O fierce the winds blew!
The foam flew in clouds,
  And dark the night grew!

And all the wild sea-water
  Climbed steep into the boat;
Back to the shore again
  Sail they will not.

Drowned is the sailorman,
  Drowned is sweet Jenny,
And drowned in the deep sea
  A bright silver penny.

I saw the lovely arch
  Of Rainbow span the sky,
The gold sun burning
  As the rain swept by.

In bright-ringed solitude
  The showery foliage shone
One lovely moment,
  And the Bow was gone.

I heard along the early hills,
  Ere yet the lark was risen up,
Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills
  The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--
I heard the fairies in a ring
  Sing as they tripped a lilting round
Soft as the moon on wavering wing.
  The starlight shook as if with sound,
As if with echoing, and the stars
  Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;
While red with war the gusty Mars
  Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.
He shone alone, low down the West,
  While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,
Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed
  The fires of the morning flush.
Till, as a mist, their beauty died,
  Their singing shrill and fainter grew;
And daylight tremulous and wide
  Flooded the moorland through and through;
Till Urdon's copper weathercock
  Was reared in golden flame afar,
And dim from moonlit dreams awoke
  The towers and groves of Arroar.

When slim Sophia mounts her horse
  And paces down the avenue,
It seems an inward melody
      She paces to.

Each narrow hoof is lifted high
  Beneath the dark enclustering pines,
A silver ray within his bit
      And bridle shines.

His eye burns deep, his tail is arched,
  And streams upon the shadowy air,
The daylight sleeks his jetty flanks,
      His mistress' hair.

Her habit flows in darkness down,
  Upon the stirrup rests her foot,
Her brow is lifted, as if earth
      She heeded not.

'Tis silent in the avenue,
  The sombre pines are mute of song,
The blue is dark, there moves no breeze
      The boughs among.

When slim Sophia mounts her horse
  And paces down the avenue,
It seems an inward melody
      She paces to.

'Twas autumn daybreak gold and wild,
  While past St. Ann's grey tower they shuffled,
Three beggars spied a fairy-child
    In crimson mantle muffled.

The daybreak lighted up her face
  All pink, and sharp, and emerald-eyed;
She looked on them a little space,
    And shrill as hautboy cried:--

"O three tall footsore men of rags
  Which walking this gold morn I see,
What will ye give me from your bags
    For fairy kisses three?"

The first, that was a reddish man,
  Out of his bundle takes a crust:
"La, by the tombstones of St. Ann,
    There's fee, if fee ye must!"

The second, that was a chestnut man,
  Out of his bundle draws a bone:
"Lo, by the belfry of St. Ann,
    And all my breakfast gone!"

The third, that was a yellow man,
  Out of his bundle picks a groat,
"La, by the Angel of St. Ann,
    And I must go without."

That changeling, lean and icy-lipped,
  Touched crust, and bone, and groat, and lo!
Beneath her finger taper-tipped
    The magic all ran through.

Instead of crust a peacock pie,
  Instead of bone sweet venison,
Instead of groat a white lily
    With seven blooms thereon.

And each fair cup was deep with wine:
  Such was the changeling's charity,
The sweet feast was enough for nine,
    But not too much for three.

O toothsome meat in jelly froze!
  O tender haunch of elfin stag!
O rich the odour that arose!
    O plump with scraps each bag!

There, in the daybreak gold and wild,
  Each merry-hearted beggar man
Drank deep unto the fairy child,
    And blessed the good St. Ann.

"Now, Jinnie, my dear, to the dwarf be off,
  That lives in Barberry Wood,
And fetch me some honey, but be sure you don't laugh,--
  He hates little girls that are rude, are rude,
    He hates little girls that are rude."

Jane tapped at the door of the house in the wood,
  And the dwarf looked over the wall,
He eyed her so queer, 'twas as much as she could
  To keep from laughing at all, at all,
    To keep from laughing at all.

His shoes down the passage came clod, clod, clod,
  And when he opened the door,
He croaked so harsh, 'twas as much as she could
  To keep from laughing the more, the more,
    To keep from laughing the more.

As there, with his bushy red beard, he stood,
  Pricked out to double its size,
He squinted so cross, 'twas as much as she could
  To keep the tears out of her eyes, her eyes,
    To keep the tears out of her eyes.

He slammed the door, and went clod, clod, clod,
  But while in the porch she bides,
He squealed so fierce, 'twas as much as she could
  To keep from cracking her sides, her sides,
    To keep from cracking her sides.

He threw a pumpkin over the wall,
  And melons and apples beside,
So thick in the air that to see them all fall,
  She laughed, and laughed, till she cried, cried, cried;
    Jane laughed and laughed till she cried.

Down fell her teardrops a pit-apat-pat,
  And red as a rose she grew;--
"Kah! kah," said the dwarf, "is it crying you're at?
  It's the very worst thing you could do, do, do,
    It's the very worst thing you could do."

He slipped like a monkey up into a tree,
  He shook her down cherries like rain;
"See now," says he, cheeping, "a blackbird I be,
  Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again--gain--gain,
    Laugh, laugh, little Jinnie, again."

Ah me! what a strange, what a gladsome duet
  From a house in the deeps of a wood!
Such shrill and such harsh voices never met yet
A-laughing as loud as they could, could, could,
    A-laughing as loud as they could.

Come Jinnie, come dwarf, cocksparrow, and bee,
  There's a ring gaudy-green in the dell,
Sing, sing, ye sweet cherubs, that flit in the tree;
  La! who can draw tears from a well, well, well,
    Who ever drew tears from a well!

The sun is clear of bird and cloud,
  The grass shines windless, grey and still,
In dusky ruin the owl dreams on,
  The cuckoo echoes on the hill;
Yet soft along Alulvan's walks
    The ghost at noonday stalks.

His eyes in shadow of his hat
  Stare on the ruins of his house;
His cloak, up-fastened with a brooch,
  Of faded velvet grey as mouse,
Brushes the roses as he goes:
    Yet wavers not one rose.

The wild birds in a cloud fly up
  From their sweet feeding in the fruit;
The droning of the bees and flies
  Rises gradual as a lute;
Is it for fear the birds are flown,
    And shrills the insect-drone?

Thick is the ivy over Alulvan,
  And crisp with summer-heat its turf;
Far, far across its empty pastures
  Alulvan's sands are white with surf:
And he himself is grey as the sea,
    Watching beneath an elder-tree.

All night the fretful, shrill Banshee
  Lurks in the ivy's dark festoons,
Calling for ever, o'er garden and river,
  Through magpie changing of the moons:
"Alulvan, O, alas! Alulvan,
  The doom of lone Alulvan!"

There came a pedlar to an evening house;
Sweet Lettice, from her lattice looking down,
Wondered what man he was, so curious
His black hair dangled on his tattered gown:
Then lifts he up his face, with glittering eyes,--
"What will you buy, sweetheart?--Here's honeycomb,
And mottled pippins, and sweet mulberry pies,
Comfits and peaches, snowy cherry bloom,
To keep in water for to make night sweet:
All that you want, sweetheart,--come, taste and eat!"

Even with his sugared words, returned to her
The clear remembrance of a gentle voice:
"And O! my child, should ever a flatterer
Tap with his wares, and promise of all joys,
And vain sweet pleasures that on earth may be,
Seal up your ears, sing some old happy song,
Confuse his magic who is all mockery:
His sweets are death." Yet, still how she doth long
But just to taste, then shut the lattice tight,
And hide her eyes from the delicious sight!

"What must I pay?" she whispered. "Pay!" says he,
"Pedlar I am who through this wood to roam,
One lock of her hair is gold enough for me,
For apple, peach, comfit, or honeycomb!"
But from her bough a drowsy squirrel cried,
"Trust him not, Lettice, trust, oh trust him not!"
And many another woodland tongue beside
Rose softly in the silence--"Trust him not!"
Then cried the Pedlar in a bitter voice,
"What, in the thicket, is this idle noise?"

A late, harsh blackbird smote him with her wings,
As through the glade, dark in the dim, she flew;
Yet still the Pedlar his old burden sings,--
"What, pretty sweetheart, shall I show to you?
Here's orange ribands, here's a string of pearls,
Here's silk of buttercup and pansy glove,
A pin of tortoiseshell for windy curls,
A box of silver, scented sweet with clove:
Come now," he says, with dim and lifted face,
"I pass not often such a lonely place."

"Pluck not a hair!" a hidden rabbit cried,
"With but one hair he'll steal thy heart away,
Then only sorrow shall thy lattice hide:
Go in! all honest pedlars come by day."
There was dead silence in the drowsy wood;
"Here's syrup for to lull sweet maids to sleep;
And bells for dreams, and fairy wine and food
All day thy heart in happiness to keep";--
And now she takes the scissors on her thumb,--
"O, then, no more unto my lattice come!"

Sad is the sound of weeping in the wood!
Now only night is where the Pedlar was;
And bleak as frost upon a quickling bud
His magic steals in darkness, O alas!
Why all the summer doth sweet Lettice pine?
And, ere the wheat is ripe, why lies her gold
Hid 'neath fresh new-plucked sprigs of eglantine?
Why all the morning hath the cuckoo tolled,
Sad, to and fro, in green and secret ways,
With solemn bells the burden of his days?

And, in the market-place, what man is this
Who wears a loop of gold upon his breast,
Stuck heartwise; and whose glassy flatteries
Take all the townsfolk ere they go to rest
Who come to buy and gossip? Doth his eye
Remember a face lovely in a wood?
O people! hasten, hasten, do not buy
His woeful wares; the bird of grief doth brood
There where his heart should be; and far away
There mourns long sorrowfulness this happy day.

'Tis moonlight on Trebarwith Vale,
  And moonlight on an Ogre keen,
Who, prowling hungry through the dale,
  A lone cottage hath seen.

Small, with thin smoke ascending up,
  Three casements and a door--
The Ogre eager is to tap,
  And here seems dainty store.

Sweet as a larder to a mouse,
  So to him staring down,
Seemed the small-windowed moonlit house,
  With jasmine overgrown.

He snorted, as the billows snort
  In darkness of the night;
Betwixt his lean locks tawny-swart,
  He glowered on the sight.

Into the garden sweet with peas
  He put his wooden shoe,
And bending back the apple trees
  Crept covetously through;

Then, stooping, with a gloating eye
  Stared through the lattice small,
And spied two children which did lie
  Asleep, against the wall.

Into their dreams no shadow fell
  Of his disastrous thumb
Groping discreet, and gradual,
  Across the quiet room.

But scarce his nail had scraped the cot
  Wherein these children lay,
As if his malice were forgot,
  It suddenly did stay.

For faintly in the ingle-nook
  He heard a cradle-song,
That rose into his thoughts and woke
  Terror them among.

For she who in the kitchen sat
  Darning by the fire,
Guileless of what he would be at,
  Sang sweet as wind or wire:--

"Lullay, thou little tiny child,
  By-by, lullay, lullie;
Jesu in glory, meek and mild,
  This night remember thee!

"Fiend, witch, and goblin, foul and wild,
  He deems them smoke to be;
Lullay, thou little tiny child,
  By-by, lullay, lullie!"

The Ogre lifted up his eyes
  Into the moon's pale ray,
And gazed upon her leopard-wise,
  Cruel and clear as day;

He snarled in gluttony and fear--
  "The wind blows dismally--
Jesu in storm my lambs be near,
  By-by, lullay, lullie!"

And like a ravenous beast which sees
  The hunter's icy eye,
So did this wretch in wrath confess
  Sweet Jesu's mastery.

Lightly he drew his greedy thumb
  From out that casement pale,
And strode, enormous, swiftly home,
  Whinnying down the dale.

  "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's sticks for your fire,
  Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,
    And beech-twigs, and briar!"
But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
She found 'twas the voice of the False Faerie.

  "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's meat for your broth,
  Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,
    And pig's trotters both!"
But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
She found 'twas the voice of the False Faerie.

 "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's a wolf at your door,
  His teeth grinning white,
    And his tongue wagging sore!"
"Nay!" said Dame Hickory, "ye False Faerie!
But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.

  "Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
    Here's buds for your tomb,
Bramble, and lavender,
    And rosemary bloom!"
"Wh-s-st!" said Dame Hickory, "ye False Faerie,
Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me."

"Shall we carry now your bundle,
You old grey man?
Over hill and dale and meadow
Lighter than an owlet's shadow
We will whirl it through the air,
Through blue regions shrill and bare,
So you may in comfort fare--
Shall we carry now your bundle,
    You old grey man?"

The Pilgrim lifted up his eyes
And saw three fiends, in the skies,
Stooping o'er that lonely place
    Evil in form and face.

"Nay," he answered, "leave me, leave me,
  Ye three wild fiends!
Far it is my feet must wander,
And my city lieth yonder
I must bear my bundle alone,
    Till the day be done."
The fiends stared down with leaden eye,
Fanning the chill air duskily,
'Twixt their hoods they stoop and cry:--

"Shall we smooth the path before you,
    You old grey man?
Sprinkle it green with gilded showers,
Strew it o'er with painted flowers,
Lure bright birds to sing and flit
In the honeyed airs of it?
Shall we smooth the path before you,
    Grey old man?"

"O, 'tis better silence, silence,
    Ye three wild fiends!
Footsore am I, faint and weary,
Dark the way, forlorn and dreary,
Beaten of wind, torn of briar,
Smitten of rain, parched with fire:
O, silence, silence, silence,
    Ye three wild fiends!"

It seemed a smoke obscured the air,
Bright lightning quivered in the gloom,
And a faint voice of thunder spake
Far in the lone hill-hollows--"Come!"
Then, half in fury, half in dread,
The fiends drew closer down, and said:

"Nay, thou stubborn fond old man,
    Hearken awhile!
Thorn, and dust, and ice and heat,
Tarry now, sit down and eat:
Heat, and ice, and dust and thorn;
Stricken, footsore, parched, forlorn--
Juice of purple grape shall be
Youth and solace unto thee.
Music of tambour, wire and wind,
Ease shall bring to heart and mind;
Wonderful sweet mouths shall sigh
Languishing and lullaby;
Turn then! Curse the dream that lures thee;
Turn thee, ere too late it be,
Lest thy three true friends grow weary
    Of comforting thee!"

The Pilgrim crouches terrified
As stooping hood, and glassy face,
Gloating, evil, side by side,
Terror and hate brood o'er the place;
He flings his withered hands on high
With a bitter, breaking cry:--
"Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me,
    Ye three wild fiends!
If I lay me down in slumber,
Then I lay me down in wrath;
If I stir not in dark dreaming,
Then I wither in my path;
If I hear sweet voices singing,
'Tis a demon's lullaby:
And, in 'hideous storm and terror,'
    Wake but to die."

And even as he spake, on high
Arrows of sunlight pierced the sky.
Bright streamed the rain. O'er burning snow
From hill to hill a wondrous bow
Of colour and fire trembled in air,
Painting its heavenly beauty there.
Wild flapped each fiend a batlike hood
Against that 'frighting light, and stood
Beating the windless rain, and then
Rose heavy and slow with cowering head,
Circled in company again,
And into darkness fled.

Marvellous sweet it was to hear
The waters gushing loud and clear;
Marvellous happy it was to be
Alone, and yet not solitary;
Oh, out of terror and dark to come
    In sight of home!

"Lady Jane, O Lady Jane!
Your hound hath broken bounds again,
  And chased my timorous deer, O;
    If him I see,
    That hour he'll dee;
  My brakes shall be his bier, O."

"Hoots! lord, speak not so proud to me!
My hound, I trow, is fleet and free,
  He's welcome to your deer, O;
    Shoot, shoot you may,
    He'll gang his way,
  Your threats we nothing fear, O."

He's fetched him in, he's laid him low,
Drips his lifeblood red and slow,
  Darkens his dreary eye, O;
   "Here is your beast,
    And now at least
  My herds in peace shall lie, O."

"'In peace!' my lord, O mark me well!
For what my jolly hound befell
  You shall sup twenty-fold, O!
    For every tooth
    Of his, in sooth,
  A stag in pawn, I hold, O.

"Huntsman and horn, huntsman and horn,
Shall scour your heaths and coverts lorn,
  Braying 'em shrill and clear, O;
    But lone and still
    Shall lift each hill,
  Each valley wan and sere, O.

"Ride up you may, ride down you may,
Lonely or trooped, by night or day,
  My hound shall haunt you ever:
    Bird, beast, and game
    Shall dread the same,
  The wild fish of your river."

Her cheek burns angry as the rose,
Her eye with wrath and pity flows:
  He gazes fierce and round, O--
    "Dear Lord!" he says,
    "What loveliness
  To waste upon a hound, O.

"I'd give my stags, my hills and dales,
My stormcocks and my nightingales
  To have undone this deed, O;
    For deep beneath
    My heart is death
  Which for her love doth bleed, O."

He wanders up, he wanders down,
On foot, a-horse, by night and noon:
  His lands are bleak and drear, O;
    Forsook his dales
    Of nightingales,
  Forsook his moors of deer, O,

Forsook his heart, ah me! of mirth;
There's nothing gladsome left on earth;
  All thoughts and dreams seem vain, O,
    Save where remote
    The moonbeams gloat,
  And sleeps the lovely Jane, O.

Until an even when lone he went,
Gnawing his beard in dreariment--
  Lo! from a thicket hidden,
    Lovely as flower
    In April hour,
  Steps forth a form unbidden.

"Get ye now down, my lord, to me!
I'm troubled so I'm like to dee,"
  She cries, 'twixt joy and grief, O;
    "The hound is dead,
    When all is said,
  But love is past belief, O.

"Nights, nights I've lain your lands to see,
Forlorn and still--and all for me,
  All for a foolish curse, O;
    Now here am I
    Come out to die--
  To live unloved is worse, O!"

In faith, this lord, in that lone dale,
Hears now a sweeter nightingale,
  And lairs a tenderer deer, O;
    His sorrow goes
    Like mountain snows
  In waters sweet and clear, O!

What ghostly hound is this that fleet
Comes fawning to his mistress' feet,
  And courses round his master?
    How swiftly love
    May grief remove,
  How happy make disaster!

Now here he smells, now there he smells,
Winding his voice along the dells,
  Till grey flows up the morn, O
    Then hies again
    To Lady Jane
  No longer now forlorn, O.

Ay, as it were a bud, did break
To loveliness for her love's sake,
  So she in beauty moving
    Rides at his hand
    Across his land,
  Beloved as well as loving.

As Lucy went a-walking one morning cold and fine,
There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:
Then "O!" said Lucy, in the snow, "it's very plain to see
A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me."

Then slept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,
And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:
And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place
Stretched black by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.

She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees
A little pool of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;
Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,
And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.

Clear sang the faint far merry peal, then silence on the air,
And icy-still the frozen pool and poplars standing there:
Then lo! as Lucy turned her head and looked along the snow
She sees a witch--a witch she sees, come frisking to and fro.

Her scarlet, buckled shoes they clicked, her heels a-twinkling high;
With mistletoe her steeple-hat bobbed as she capered by;
But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,
Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she lissomely.

It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;
It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tossed;
It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:
"Nay!" Lucy said, "it is the wind that through the branches flows."

And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,
And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,
And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before,
And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four--

"O! who are ye," sweet Lucy cries, "that in a dreadful ring,
All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?"
"A witch, and witches, one and nine," they straight to her reply,
And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.

Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold green cherry trees upgrow,
And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;
She smells, all faint, the almond-boughs blowing so wild and fair,
And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.

Clear flowers she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,
With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;
And, as with ropes of amethyst, the boughs with lamps were hung,
And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.

"O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!
Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?"
But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,
Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;

Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,
Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,
Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,
But like a dream that vanishes, so vanished were they all.

When Lucy sees, and only sees three crows upon a bough,
And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,
Then "O!" said Lucy, "three times three is nine--I plainly see
Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me."

I met a sailor in the woods,
  A silver ring wore he,
His hair hung black, his eyes shone blue,
  And thus he said to me:--

"What country, say, of this round earth,
  What shore of what salt sea,
Be this, my son, I wander in,
  And looks so strange to me?"

Says I, "O foreign sailorman,
  In England now you be,
This is her wood, and there her sky,
  And that her roaring sea."

He lifts his voice yet louder,
  "What smell be this," says he,
"My nose on the sharp morning air
  Snuffs up so greedily?"

Says I, "It is wild roses
  Do smell so winsomely,
And winy briar, too," says I,
  "That in these thickets be."

"And oh!" says he, "what leetle bird
  Is singing in yon high tree,
So every shrill and long-drawn note
  Like bubbles breaks in me?"

Says I, "It is the mavis
  That perches in the tree,
And sings so shrill, and sings so sweet,
  When dawn comes up the sea."

At which he fell a-musing,
  And fixed his eye on me,
As one alone 'twixt light and dark
  A spirit thinks to see.

"England!" he whispers soft and harsh,
  "England!" repeated he,
"And briar, and rose, and mavis,
  A-singing in yon high tree.

"Ye speak me true, my leetle son,
  So--so, it came to me,
A-drifting landwards on a spar,
  And grey dawn on the sea.

"Ay, ay, I could not be mistook;
  I knew them leafy trees,
I knew that land so witchery sweet,
  And that old noise of seas.

"Though here I've sailed a score of years,
  And heard 'em, dream or wake,
Lap small and hollow 'gainst my cheek,
  On sand and coral break;

"'Yet now,' my leetle son, says I,
  A-drifting on the wave,
'That land I see so safe and green,
  Is England, I believe.

"'And that there wood is English wood,
  And this here cruel sea,
The selfsame old blue ocean
  Years gone remembers me.

"'A-sitting with my bread and butter
  Down ahind yon chitterin' mill;
And this same Marinere'--(that's me),
  'Is that same leetle Will!--

"'That very same wee leetle Will
  Eating his bread and butter there,
A-looking on the broad blue sea
  Betwixt his yaller hair!'

"And here be I, my son, thrown up
  Like corpses from the sea,
Ships, stars, winds, tempests, pirates past,
  Yet leetle Will I be!"

He said no more, that sailorman,
  But in a reverie
Stared like the figure of a ship
  With painted eyes to sea.

"Upstairs in the large closet, child,
  This side the blue room door,
Is an old Bible, bound in leather,
  Standing upon the floor;

"Go with this taper, bring it me;
  Carry it so, upon your arm;
It is the book on many a sea
  Hath stilled the waves' alarm."

Late the hour, dark the night,
  The house is solitary;
Feeble is a taper's light
  To light poor Ann to see.

Her eyes are yet with visions bright
  Of sylph and river, flower and fay,
Now through a narrow corridor
  She goes her lonely way.

Vast shadows on the heedless walls
  Gigantic loom, stoop low:
Each little hasty footfall calls
  Hollowly to and fro.

In the cold solitude her heart
  Remembers sorrowfully
White winters when her mother was
  Her loving company.

Now in the dark clear glass she sees
  A taper, mocking hers,--
A phantom face of light blue eyes,
  Reflecting phantom fears.

Around her loom the vacant rooms,
  Wind the upward stairs,
She climbs on into a loneliness
  Only her taper shares.

Out in the dark a cold wind stirs,
  At every window sighs;
A waning moon peers small and chill
  From out the cloudy skies,

Casting faint tracery on the walls;
  So stony still the house
From cellar to attic rings the shrill
  Squeak of the hungry mouse.

Her grandmother is deaf with age;
  A garden of moonless trees
Would answer not though she should cry
  In anguish on her knees.

So that she scarce can breathe--so fast
  Her pent up heart doth beat--
When, faint along the corridor,
  Falleth the sound of feet:--

Sounds lighter than silk slippers make
  Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet
Violin and 'cello wake
  Music for twirling feet.

O! 'neath an old unfriendly roof,
  What shapes may not conceal
Their faces in the open day,
  At night abroad to steal?

Even her taper seems with fear
  To languish small and blue;
Far in the woods the winter wind
  Runs whistling through.

A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,
  Her mouth is stretched to cry,
But sudden, with a gush of joy,
  It narrows to a sigh.

It is a phantom child which comes
  Soft through the corridor,
Singing an old forgotten song,
  This ancient burden bore:--

"Thorn, thorn, I wis,
And roses twain,
  A red rose and a white,
Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss
  A lonely child good-night.

"Swim fish, sing bird,
And sigh again,
  I that am lost am lone,
Bee in the blossom never stirred
  Locks hid beneath a stone!"--

Her eye was of the azure fire
  That hovers in wintry flame;
Her raiment wild and yellow as furze
  That spouteth out the same;

And in her hand she bore no flower,
  But on her head a wreath
Of faded flowers that did yet
  Smell sweetly after death....

Gloomy with night the listening walls
  Are now that she is gone,
Albeit this solitary child
  No longer seems alone.

Fast though her taper dwindles down,
  Heavy and thick the tome,
A beauty beyond fear to dim
  Haunts now her alien home.

Ghosts in the world, malignant, grim,
  Vex many a wood and glen,
And house and pool--the unquiet ghosts,
  Of dead and restless men.

But in her grannie's house this spirit--
  A child as lone as she--
Pining for love not found on earth,
  Ann dreams again to see.

Seated upon her tapestry stool,
  Her fairy-book laid by,
She gazes into the fire, knowing
  She has sweet company.

A twangling harp for Mary,
  A silvery flute for John,
And now we'll play, the livelong day,
  "The Miller and his Son."...

"The Miller went a-walking
  All in the forest high,
He sees three doves a-flitting
  Against the dark blue sky:

"Says he, 'My son, now follow
  These doves so white and free,
That cry above the forest,
  And surely cry to thee.'

"'I go, my dearest Father,
  But O! I sadly fear,
These doves so white will lead me far,
  But never bring me near.'

"He kisses the Miller,
  He cries, 'Awhoop to ye!'
And straightway through the forest
  Follows the wood-doves three.

"There came a sound of weeping
  To the Miller in his Mill:
Red roses in a thicket
  Bloomed over near his wheel;

"Three stars shone wild and brightly
  Above the forest dim:
But never his dearest son
  Returns again to him.

"The cuckoo shall call 'Cuckoo!'
  In vain along the vale--
The linnet, and the blackbird,
  The mournful nightingale;

"The Miller hears and sees not,
  Thinking of his son;
His toppling wheel is silent;
  His grinding done.

"'You doves so white,' he weepeth,
  'You roses on the tree,
You stars that shine so brightly,
  You shine in vain for me!

"'I bade him follow, follow!'
  He said, 'O Father dear,
These doves so white will lead me far
  But never bring me near.'"...

A twangling harp for Mary,
  A silvery flute for John,
And now we'll play, the livelong day,
  "The Miller and his Son."

Down-adown-derry,
  Sweet Annie Maroon,
Gathering daisies
  In the meadows of Doone,
Hears a shrill piping,
  Elflike and free,
Where the waters go brawling
  In rills to the sea;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Sweet Annie Maroon,
Through the green grasses
  Peeps softly; and soon
Spies under green willows
  A fairy whose song
Like the smallest of bubbles
  Floats bobbing along;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Her cheeks were like wine,
Her eyes in her wee face
  Like water-sparks shine,
Her niminy fingers
  Her sleep tresses preen,
The which in the combing
  She peeps out between;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Shrill, shrill was her tune:--
"Come to my water-house,
  Annie Maroon:
Come in your dimity,
  Ribbon on head,
To wear siller seaweed
  And coral instead";
    Singing down-adown-derry.

"Down-adown-derry,
  Lean fish of the sea,
Bring lanthorns for feasting
  The gay Faërie;
'Tis sand for the dancing,
  A music all sweet
In the water-green gloaming
  For thistledown feet";
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  Sweet Annie Maroon
Looked large on the fairy
  Curled wan as the moon;
And all the grey ripples
  To the Mill racing by,
With harps and with timbrels
  Did ringing reply;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

"Down-adown-derry,"
  Sang the Fairy of Doone,
Piercing the heart
  Of sweet Annie Maroon;
And lo! when like roses
  The clouds of the sun
Faded at dusk, gone
  Was Annie Maroon;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  The daisies are few;
Frost twinkles powdery
  In haunts of the dew;
And only the robin
  Perched on a thorn,
Can comfort the heart
  Of a father forlorn;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

Down-adown-derry,
  There's snow in the air;
Ice where the lily
  Bloomed waxen and fair;
He may call o'er the water,
  Cry--cry through the Mill,
But Annie Maroon, alas!
  Answer ne'er will;
    Singing down-adown-derry.

A wolf he pricks with eyes of fire
Across the night's o'ercrusted snows.
    Seeking his prey,
    He pads his way
Where Jane benighted goes,
  Where Jane benighted goes.

He curdles the bleak air with ire,
Ruffling his hoary raiment through,
    And lo! he sees
    Beneath the trees
Where Jane's light footsteps go,
  Where Jane's light footsteps go.

No hound peals thus in wicked joy,
He snaps his muzzle in the snows,
    His five-clawed feet
    Do scamper fleet
Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows,
  Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows.

Now his greed's green doth gaze unseen
On a pure face of wilding rose,
    Her amber eyes
    In fear's surprise
Watch largely as she goes,
  Watch largely as she goes.

Salt wells his hunger in his jaws,
His lust it revels to and fro,
    Yet small beneath
    A soft voice saith,
"Jane shall in safety go,
  Jane shall in safety go."

He lurched as if a fiery lash
Had scourged his hide, and through and through
    His furious eyes
    O'erscanned the skies,
But nearer dared not go,
  But nearer dared not go.

He reared like wild Bucephalus,
His fangs like spears in him uprose,
    Even to the town
    Jane's flitting gown
He grins on as she goes,
  He grins on as she goes.

In fierce lament he howls amain,
He scampers, marvelling in his throes
    What brought him there
    To sup on air,
While Jane unharmèd goes,
  While Jane unharmèd goes.

Three dwarfs there were which lived in an isle,
  And the name of that Isle was Lone,
And the names of the dwarfs were Alliolyle,
  Lallerie, Muziomone.

Alliolye was green of een,
  Lallerie light of locks,
Muziomone was mild of mien,
  As ewes in April flocks.

Their house was small and sweet of the sea,
  And pale as the Malmsey wine;
Their bowls were three, and their beds were three,
  And their nightcaps white were nine.

Their beds they were made of the holly-wood,
  Their combs of the tortoise's shell,
Three basins of silver in corners there stood,
  And three little ewers as well.

Green rushes, green rushes lay thick on the floor,
  For light beamed a gobbet of wax;
There were three wooden stools for whatever they wore
  On their humpity-dumpity backs.

So each would lie on a drowsy pillow
  And watch the moon in the sky--
And hear the parrot scream to the billow,
  The billow roar reply:

Parrots of sapphire and sulphur and amber,
  Scarlet, and flame, and green,
While five-foot apes did scramble and clamber,
  In the feathery-tufted treen.

All night long with bubbles a-glisten
  The ocean cried under the moon,
Till ape and parrot, too sleepy to listen,
  To sleep and slumber were gone.

Then from three small beds the dark hours' while
  In a house in the Island of Lone
Rose the snoring of Lallerie, Alliolyle,
  The snoring of Muziomone.

But soon as ever came peep of sun
  On coral and feathery tree,
Three night-capped dwarfs to the surf would run
  And soon were a-bob in the sea.

At six they went fishing, at nine they snared
  Young foxes in the dells,
At noon on sweet berries and honey they fared,
  And blew in their twisted shells.

Dark was the sea they gambolled in,
  And thick with silver fish,
Dark as green glass blown clear and thin
  To be a monarch's dish.

They sate to sup in a jasmine bower,
  Lit pale with flies of fire,
Their bowls the hue of the iris-flower,
  And lemon their attire.

Sweet wine in little cups they sipped,
  And golden honeycomb
Into their bowls of cream they dipped,
  Whipt light and white as foam.

Now Alliolyle, where the sand-flower blows,
  Taught three old apes to sing--
Taught three old apes to dance on their toes
  And caper around in a ring.

They yelled them hoarse and they croaked them sweet,
  They twirled them about and around,
To the noise of their voices they danced with their feet,
  They stamped with their feet on the ground.

But down to the shore skipped Lallerie,
  His parrot on his thumb,
And the twain they scotched in mockery,
  While the dancers go and come.

And, alas! in the evening, rosy and still,
  Light-haired Lallerie
Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle
  By the yellow-sanded sea.

The rising moon swam sweet and large
  Before their furious eyes,
And they rolled and rolled to the coral marge
  Where the surf for ever cries.

Too late, too late, comes Muziomone:
  Clear in the clear green sea
Alliolyle lies not alone,
  But clasped with Lallerie.

He blows on his shell plaintiff notes;
  Ape, parraquito, bee
Flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats,--
  The shoe of Lallerie.

He fetches nightcaps, one and nine,
  Grey apes he dowers three,
His house as fair as the Malmsey wine
  Seems sad as cypress-tree.

Three bowls he brims with sweet honeycomb
  To feast the bumble bees,
Saying, "O bees, be this your home,
  For grief is on the seas!"

He sate him lone in a coral grot,
  At the flowing in of the tide;
When ebbed the billow, there was not,
  Save coral, aught beside.

So hairy apes in three white beds,
  And nightcaps, one and nine,
On moonlit pillows lay three heads
  Bemused with dwarfish wine.

A tomb of coral, the dirge of bee,
  The grey apes' guttural groan
For Alliolyle, for Lallerie,
  For thee, O Muziomone!

The scent of bramble fills the air,
  Amid her folded sheets she lies,
The gold of evening in her hair,
  The blue of morn shut in her eyes.

How many a changing moon hath lit
  The unchanging roses of her face!
Her mirror ever broods on it
  In silver stillness of the days.

Oft flits the moth on filmy wings
  Into his solitary lair;
Shrill evensong the cricket sings
  From some still shadow in her hair.

In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,
  She sleeps in lovely loneliness,
Half-folded like an April bud
  On winter-haunted trees.

Hark! is that a horn I hear,
  In cloudland winding sweet--
And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,
  And silver-shod light feet?

Is it the elfin laughter
  Of fairies riding faint and high,
Beneath the branches of the moon,
  Straying through the starry sky?

Is it in the globèd dew
  Such sweet melodies may fall?
Wood and valley--all are still,
  Hushed the shepherd's call.

Out of the East a hurricane
  Swept down on Captain Lean--
That mariner and gentleman
  Will never again be seen.

He sailed his ship against the foes
  Of his own country dear,
But now in the trough of the billows
  An aimless course doth steer.

Powder was violets to his nostrils,
  Sweet the din of the fighting-line,
Now he is flotsam on the seas,
  And his bones are bleached with brine.

The stars move up along the sky,
  The moon she shines so bright,
And in that solitude the foam
  Sparkles unearthly white.

This is the tomb of Captain Lean,
  Would a straiter please his soul?
I trow he sleeps in peace,
  Howsoever the billows roll!

His brow is seamed with line and scar;
  His cheek is red and dark as wine;
The fires as of a Northern star
  Beneath his cap of sable shine.

His right hand, bared of leathern glove,
  Hangs open like an iron gin,
You stoop to see his pulses move,
  To hear the blood sweep out and in.

He looks some king, so solitary
  In earnest thought he seems to stand,
As if across a lonely sea
  He gazed impatient of the land.

Out of the noisy centuries
  The foolish and the fearful fade;
Yet burn unquenched these warrior eyes,
  Time hath not dimmed, nor death dismayed.

From out the wood I watched them shine,--
  The windows of the haunted house,
Now ruddy as enchanted wine,
  Now dark as flittermouse.

There went a thin voice piping airs
  Along the grey and crooked walks,--
A garden of thistledown and tares,
  Bright leaves, and giant stalks.

The twilight rain shone at its gates,
  Where long-leaved grass in shadow grew;
And black in silence to her mates
  A voiceless raven flew.

Lichen and moss the lone stones greened,
  Green paths led lightly to its door,
Keen from her hair the spider leaned,
  And dusk to darkness wore.

Amidst the sedge a whisper ran,
  The West shut down a heavy eye,
And like last tapers, few and wan,
  The watch-stars kindled in the sky.

"Build me my tomb," the Raven said,
  "Within the dark yew-tree,
So in the Autumn yewberries
  Sad lamps may burn for me.
Summon the haunted beetle,
  From twilight bud and bloom,
To drone a gloomy dirge for me
  At dusk above my tomb.
Beseech ye too the glowworm
  To rear her cloudy flame,
Where the small, flickering bats resort,
  Whistling in tears my name.
Let the round dew a whisper make,
  Welling on twig and thorn;
And only the grey cock at night
  Call through his silver horn.
And you, dear sisters, don your black
  For ever and a day,
To show how true a raven
  In his tomb is laid away."

The bells chime clear,
Soon will the sun behind the hills sink down;
Come, little Ann, your baby brother dear
Lies in his christening-gown.

His godparents,
Are all across the fields stepped on before,
And wait beneath the crumbling monuments,
This side the old church door.

Your mammie dear
Leans frail and lovely on your daddie's arm;
Watching her chick, 'twixt happiness and fear,
Lest he should come to harm.

All to be blest
Full soon in the clear heavenly water, he
Sleeps on unwitting of it, his little breast
Heaving so tenderly.

I carried you,
My little Ann, long since on this same quest,
And from the painted windows a pale hue
Lit golden on your breast;

And then you woke,
Chill as the holy water trickled down,
And, weeping, cast the window a strange look,
Half smile, half infant frown.

I scarce could hear
The shrill larks singing in the green meadows,
'Twas summertide, and, budding far and near,
The hedges thick with rose.

And now you're grown
A little girl, and this same helpless mite
Is come like such another bud half-grown,
Out of the wintry night.

Time flies, time flies!
And yet, bless me! 'tis little changed am I;
May Jesu keep from tears those infant eyes,
Be love their lullaby!

They dressed us up in black,
  Susan and Tom and me--
And, walking through the fields
  All beautiful to see,
With branches high in the air
  And daisy and buttercup,
We heard the lark in the clouds--
  In black dressed up.

They took us to the graves,
  Susan and Tom and me,
Where the long grasses grow
  And the funeral tree:
We stood and watched; and the wind
  Came softly out of the sky
And blew in Susan's hair,
  As I stood close by.

Back through the fields we came,
  Tom and Susan and me,
And we sat in the nursery together,
  And had our tea.
And, looking out of the window,
  I heard the thrushes sing;
But Tom fell asleep in his chair,
  He was so tired, poor thing.

Through the green twilight of a hedge
I peered, with cheek on the cool leaves pressed,
And spied a bird upon a nest:
Two eyes she had beseeching me
Meekly and brave, and her brown breast
Throbbed hot and quick above her heart;
And then she opened her dagger bill,--
'Twas not a chirp, as sparrows pipe
At break of day; 'twas not a trill,
As falters through the quiet even;
But one sharp solitary note,
One desperate, fierce, and vivid cry
Of valiant tears, and hopeless joy,
One passionate note of victory;
Off, like a fool afraid, I sneaked,
Smiling the smile the fool smiles best,
At the mother bird in the secret hedge
Patient upon her lonely nest.

I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,
  And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,
And trimly turn my silken sheet
  Upon my quilt of gentle blue.

My pillow sweet of lavender
  Smooth with an amiable hand,
And may the dark pass peacefully by
  As in the hour-glass droops the sand.

Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,
  And in my little crystal cup
Pour out the blithe and flowering mead
  That forthwith I may sup.

Withdraw my curtains from the night,
  And let the crispèd crescent shine
Upon my eyelids while I sleep,
  And soothe me with her beams benign.

Dark looks the forest far-away;
  O, listen! through its empty dales
Rings from the solemn echoing boughs
  The music of its nightingales.

Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,
  And bid the harpers harp that tune
Fairies which haunt the meadowlands
  Sing clearly to the stars of June.

And bid them play, though I in dreams
  No longer heed their pining strains,
For I would not to silence wake
  When slumber o'er my senses wanes.

You Angels bright who me defend,
  Enshadow me with curvèd wing,
And keep me in the darksome night.
  Till dawn another day do bring.

When the light of day declines,
And a swift angel through the sky
Kindles God's tapers clear,
With ashen staff the lamplighter
Passes along the darkling streets
To light our earthly lamps;

Lest, prowling in the darkness,
The thief should haunt with quiet tread,
Or men on evil errands set;
Or wayfarers be benighted;
Or neighbors, bent from house to house,
Should need a guiding torch.

He is like a needlewoman
Who deftly on a sable hem
Stitches in gleaming jewels;
Or, haply, he is like a hero,
Whose bright deeds on the long journey
Are beacons on our way.

And when in the East comes morning,
And the broad splendour of the sun,
Then, with the tune of little birds
Rings on high, the lamplighter
Passes by each quiet house,
And he puts out the lamps.

I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
  His was a still and lovely face,
He wandered through a valley steep,
  Lovely in a lonely place.

His garb was grey of lavender,
  About his brows a poppy-wreath
Burned like dim coals, and everywhere
  The air was sweeter for his breath.

His twilight feet no sandals wore,
  His eyes shone faint in their own flame,
Fair moths that gloomed his steps before
  Seemed letters of his lovely name.

His house is in the mountain ways,
  A phantom house of misty walls,
Whose golden flocks at evening graze,
  And witch the moon with muffled calls.

Upwelling from his shadowy springs
  Sweet waters shake a trembling sound,
There flit the hoot-owl's silent wings,
  There hath his web the silkworm wound.

Dark in his pools clear visions lurk,
  And rosy, as with morning buds,
Along his dales of broom and birk
  Dreams haunt his solitary woods.

I met at eve the Prince of Sleep,
  His was a still and lovely face,
He wandered through a valley steep,
  Lovely in a lonely place.

Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul;
The little mouse cheeps plaintively,
The night-bird in the chestnut-tree--
They sing together, bird and mouse,
In starlight, in darkness, lonely, sweet,
The wild notes and the faint notes meet--
  Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul.

Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul;
Amid the lilies floats the moth,
The mole along his galleries goeth
In the dark earth; the summer moon
Looks like a shepherd through the pane
Seeking his feeble lamp again--
  Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul.

Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul;
Time comes to keep night-watch with thee,
Nodding with roses; and the sea
Saith "Peace! Peace!" amid his foam.
"O be still!"
The wind cries up the whispering hill--
  Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul.

Child, do you love the flower
  Ashine with colour and dew
Lighting its transient hour?
    So I love you.

The lambs in the mead are at play,
  'Neath a hurdle the shepherd's asleep;
From height to height of the day
    The sunbeams sweep.

Evening will come. And alone
  The dreamer the dark will beguile;
All the world will be gone
    For a dream's brief while.

Then I shall be old; and away:
  And you, with sad joy in your eyes,
Will brood over children at play
    With as loveful surmise.

  What lineage so noble as from Sires,
      Laureled by Freedom? For, who, but the brave
      Have glory to transmit? The Hero's grave
  Blooms ever. It is there the spring retires
  To dream to flowers, her heart and soul desires,
      When winter's whitening wind, like wash of wave,
      Sweeps mauseleums of the skulk and knave
  From mounts of glare off to Oblivion's mires.

  The bloom, for which mere wealth lacks length of arm,
      And fainting Time takes for reviving scent,
      Fame, with bright eyes from heart and soul content,
  Forms wreaths for Valor's Daughters--crowns that charm
  Not with death-smells from Human welfare rent
      But breath of Country's rescue from dire harm.

  Those crowns, not cold from death sweat on the brow,
      At sight of apparitions with fixed stare,
      But warm with summer, conjuring beauties rare--
  Wilt not. They are dewed daily by your vow,
  Daughters of sires who, to no thrall, would bow!
      Which, at the alter with raised hands, ye swear,
      Cheering the blessed spirits, gathered there,
  That, like their Mothers, are their daughters now.

  True women--and therefore, craft foilers clever--
      With sons for your hearts utterance, ye sue
      Not, but like Barry to the British crew,
  Ye cry out: "What! we strike our colors? Never!
  Fie, shot! fie, Gold! these colors, since they drew
      Their first star-breath, are God's, and God's forever."


  Ye know the Leopard changes not his spots.
      The Prince of Peace, who spake eternal truth,
      Confirmed this fact of Nature. He, with ruth
  Omniscient, saw afar, the scarlet clots
  Of English nature, in profidious plots
      For conquest, mangling not alone brave youth
      With teeth set, but old age without a tooth,
  And Mothers, clutching up their bleeding tots.

  Oh, yea, this beast makes his own desert, still;
      And Ireland, India and Egypt show
      His spots so spread, he is one ghastly glow;
  Aye, as your sires saw him from Bunker Hill.
  Oh, vain, gold rubs the skin and press shouts, "Lo!
      It has not now one spot of threatening ill."

  O Daughters of the brave, well ye abjure
      The fiend and all his works. Ye know his smiles
      Are fire-fly flare at gloaming, lighting miles
  Of snake-boughed forests down to swamps, impure
  From mind and soul decay; hence are heart-sure
      That creed and racial hatreds are his wiles,
      For God is Love, and Love draws, reconsiles,
  And is the strength that makes our land endure.

  O Mothers, as you lift your babes and gaze
      Into their eyes, your love runs through their vains
      In crimson flushes--oh, your love that pains
  At any of God's creatures hurt! that stays;
  The heavens may pass away, but that remains,
      Being of Christ, who walks earth Mother-ways.

  Oh, like your sires, you, too, know Freedom's worth
      To Human Spirit. For its liberation,
      A God unrealmed himself by tribulation,
  And was an out-cast on a scornful earth.
  Christ is no myth and, since with Human birth
      He forms new Heavens for blissful habitation--
      There unto is the Freedom of the Nation;
  All other trend is down to dark and dearth.

  When from the darkness rainbowed birth comes pouring,
      Your virtue heeds the voice, Eternity--
      Re-echos: "Let them come." 'Tis Nature's plea
  For broadening progress; Nay, 'tis God imploring
  The Human to take strength for Liberty,
      Truth, Honor, to catch up to the stars, a-soaring.

  O Daughters of brave sires, what is true glory?
    No marsh-ward falling star, however bright.
    'Tis inspirational; its upward flight
  Lifts generations--such your Father's story,
  And also yours, for is not that, too, gory?
    You pour out your hearts blood in sons to fight
    For honor, and cease not till every right
  Has been set down in Triumph's inventory.

  Oh, into daughters, too, old noble Mothers!
    You pour out your hearts blood that, in your place,
    They may fill up the ranks and, as in case
  Of Molly Pitcher, man guns for their brothers,
  And hearten firm, the trembling human race
    To know, though brave men fall, there still comes others.

  If Christ's foreshadowing in Juda's haze
    Was of his grief, 'tis of His triumph, here,
    For, is not His celestrial glory clear
  In Freedom for all men? First, gaseous rays
  In Maryland, then rounded firm full blaze
    In the Republic, it draws every sphere
    Of Human welfare, whether far or near,
  From depths occult to nights with dawns and days.

  The Freedom of the Generation's longing
    Reflects Lord Christ in glory, hour by hour,
    With more distinctness, as you, with His power,
  Free heart and brain from every brother-wronging,
  And give your offspring, these, as flesh and dower,
    To live and lead the millions, hither thronging.

  Oh, ever Mothers--shaping robust youth
      No less than infant, and as perfectly!
      There's life blood to their veins from when on knee
  To when thy battle, from your broadening ruth
  For Human kind and fervent love of truth.
      If, like their fathers, they have come to be
      The wonder of the world, for liberty,
  Your virtue, 'tis, that in their valor greweth.

  Oh, as the Roman Mother, when she showed
      For jewels, her two sons, saw each of them
      In Time's Tiara, glittering there a gem;
  So, see your offspring shine. The light, bestowed
  Your Fathers, in your sons is diamond flame,
      Encircling Freedom's ocean-walled abode.

  Is it Apocalyptic Vision, when
      White-winged Columbus swoops from Spain's palmed shore
      And, from dark depths, lifts at San Salvador,
  A continent, adrip with streams which, then,
  Become the fountain of the Psalmist's ken,
      Where Right the heart, from hoof to horn foam-hoar
      From craggy speed, slakes thirst, and, evermore,
  Comes Hope's whole clattering herd?--you chant, "Amen."

  Aye, for your sires made earth this new creation
      Where, from San Salvadore and Plymouth Reef
      To Westward Mission Trails, ascends belief
  In God and, therefore, in the Soul's Salvation
  Through Freedom, in white, spiral spray which grief
      Sees, spite earth-mists, or solar obscuration.

  Soar thou aloft, though thou ascend alone,
      O Human Spirit! Thou canst not be lost.
      What though yon stars, the azure's nightly frost
  Melt dark, or mount round thee an arctic zone!
  Thou hast sun-warmth and star-source of thine own.
      If thou mount not, how bitter is the cost!
      What anguish, when whirled down, or tempest tossed,
  To know how high toward God thou mightst have flown!

  Vault Godward, Poet. What though few may climb
      The mountain and the star on trail of thee?
      Thy wing-flash beams toward Man, and, if it be
  True inspiration--whether thought sublime,
      Or fervor for the Truth, or Liberty--
  Thy light will reach the earth in goodly time.

  Forming the great Atlantic, see God take
      The mist from woe's white mountain, spring and stream,
      The breath of man in frost, the spiral lean
  From roof-cracked caves where, though the heart may break,
  The soul will not lie torpid, like the snake,--
      And battle smoke. On them He breathes with dream
      And, Lo! an Angel with a sword agleam
  'Twix the Old World and New for Justice's sake.

  What sea so broad, as that from Human weeping?
      Or Sun so flaming, as the Angel's sword
      Of Human and Devine Wills in accord?
  There, with sword-flash of myriad waves, joy-leaping,
      Shall loom forever, Freedom's watch and ward,
      With the New World in his Seraphic keeping.

  This is thy glory, Man, that thou art free.
      'Tis in thy freedom, thy resemblance lies
      To thy Creator. Nature, which, tide-wise,
  Is flood and ebb, bounds not sky flight for thee.
  Lo! as the sun arises from the sea,
      Startling all beauty God-ward, thou dost rise
      With mind to God in heaven, from finite ties,
  And there, in freedom, thou art great as He.

  Meeting thy God with mind, 'tis thine to choose,
      Wheather to follow him with love and soar,
      Or dream Him myth and, rather than adore,
  Plunge headlong into Nature's whirl and ooze.
  Thine is full freedom. Ah! could God do more
      To liken thee to Him, and love, infuse?

  God loves the stars; else why star-shape the dew
      For the unbreathing, shy, heart-hiding rose?
      And when earth darkens, and the North wind blows,
  Why into stars, flake every cloud's black brew?
  What fitter forms for longings high and true,
      Man's hopes, ideals, than bright orbs like those
      Asbine from Nature's dawn to Nature's close,
  In clusters, prisming every dazzling hue?

  Nor is the Sun with harvests in its heat,
      And that, sky-hidden, makes the moon at night,
      An earth-ward cascade for its leaps of light,
  More real, or a world force more complete,
  Than Faith and Hope, that brake through clouds with sight
      Of evil's foil and ultimate defeat.

  O Freedom! Born amid resplendent spheres,
      And, with God-like creative power, endowed,
      Hast thou, to human life's blue depths, not vowed
  A splendor, not alone like that which 'pears
  At present, where the upper asure clears,
      But that the Nebulae will yet unshroud?
      I hear thy far off cry where thou art lone,
  A John the Baptist: "Lo! one greater nears."

  What is this Greater--this which is to meet
      The planets and ascend high, high and higher?
      The right of human spirit to aspire
  And mount, unhampered--and by act, complete
      Creations harmony, as by desire,
      Proclaimed by brain with throb, by heart with beat.

  In thy descent through azures, all aglow
      With circling spheres, the beauty of each blaze,
      And grandeur, then, of all, entrance thy gaze.
  Thou thinkest, why not thus all life below?
  Perceiving, then that all the breezes blow
      Upward and onward, in the skyey maze,
      Thou wouldst go back and start with them, to raise
  A new creation from chaotic throe.

  Thou seest plainly that without that breeze,
      The breath of God, all that thou couldst create,
      Were lifeless, save to turn on thee with hate,
  And chase an age with grim atrocities;
      But with that breath, thou couldst raise life to mate
      The Planet's splendor, in the azures Peace.

  O Freedom! as thy sister spirit, Spring,
      Pausing above the earth, sees every hue
      Of her prismatic crown, reflected true
  In forests and in fields, and fledgling's wing,
  So thou dost see thy spirit glorying
      With faith, that man is more than Nature's spew--
      In human spirit that, from beauty drew
  First breath to know that soul is more than thing.

  O Freedom! fain we follow thee in flight
      From chaos to God's glory round and round,
      Aloft! how like an elk pursued by hound,
  To brinks thou springest toward the distant height
      And, on bent knees, then speedest without sound,
      Like Faith through Death, till, lo! thou dost alight.

  "Ye Wreaches, who would lay proud England's head
      Upon the block, and raise her features, then,
      Bloodless and ghastly, for the scorn of men!
  Begone forever. Go where terrors spread
  Their sea and forest mouths to crush you dead.
      Oh, how the clouds shall crimson from each glen,
      A roar with blaze, and flame search out each fen,
  If back to us, yea e'er are vomited."

  To this Parental blessing and God-speed,
      The Pilgrim Fathers gladly made reply:
      "These waves are Conscience's wings along the sky;
  They carry us to God, whose call we heed.
      The further from thy coast of hate and lie,
      The nearer God. On! On!--that is our creed."

  O Sun and Stars! bear ye Earth's thanks to God;
      For Oh! what waters, slaking every thirst
      Of heart, mind, spirit, in long cascades burst
  From Plymouth Rock, when struck by Freedom's rod!
  No wanderer in the burning sand, unshod,
      Plods man with lolling tongue, dog-like, as erst;
      For lo! this fountain, deepening from the first,
  Floods Earth's old wells and greens Life's sand to sod.

  Oh, more those waters than the Font of Youth,
      For which, through field and swamp, the Spaniard ran!
      For they are clear with God's eternal truth
  Of fatherhood, hence brotherhood of man,
      And are no dream. They quench all human drouth
      And cleanse man's desert dust of sect and clan.

  Of Expeditions in the Arctic Past,
      All honor to the one that reached the pole
      And formed a settlement where every soul
  Enjoyed full freedom. There above the blast,
  How musical the bell, by Justice cast!
      It welcomed all to come. It ceased to toll
      After a while, but why? Those, welcomed, stole
  And dragged it where the ice formed thick and fast.

  Of Arctic Expeditions there is none
      So profitable to the human race
      As that toward Freedom's pole, and hence men face
  All storms to reach it. If they fail, the sun
      Has but one joy--to thaw out wrecks, and trace
      Man's progress where alone it can be done.

  Say, what is Ma-jest-y without externals?
      Is Burke's analysis not right--"A Jest"?
      Ah, but a jest, at which the poor, oft pressed
  To their last heart-drop, laugh not, like court journals.
  The King needs coin, and, where he sowed no kernels,
      Wants the whole forest for his hawks to nest
      And breed in, and became an annual pest;
  In this the farmers show that they discern ills.

  Hark! blares the tyrant's horn and, in a thrice,
      The Tories gather. Eagerly they band,
      For is the King not greater than the land?
  And rows with royalty, a rabble's vice?
      Besides, what creeping tribes at his command,
      And Spies and Hessians at a ferret's price!

  To Arms! shouts Freedom to her sons. Behold!
      How, like Job's war-horse, they gulp down the ground
      To battle! What care they how foes surround?
  Oh, joy to Celts, nigh half the true and bold!
  There, with the roar of all their wrongs uprolled
      From ancient depths, they dash with billow-bound
      Up rock and summit, and through cave and mound,
  Spurning both Tyrants' steel and Treason's gold.

  No tide are they to ebb in heart and spirit.
      If dashed back, they return with all the force
      Of six dark sea's momentum on its course
  For vengeance on the vile, who disinherit
      The human-being--shut off every source
      Of happiness, or let but Serf's draw near it!

  The wounded Sidney, who despite his thirst,
      Gave water to his comrade, shines, a lamp
      In the Cimerian dark of Britain's camp.
  Even the Raleigh, who so finely versed,
  Preferred to such a light, the flame accursed
      Of sword and torch, to please a royal vamp.
      Is British triumph in its world-wide tramp
  The Hell, still "lower than lowest"--Milton's worst?

  Lord Christ! is British soldiery the swine,
      In whose gross forms the fiends, exercised, flew?
      Oh! watch them through the ages, they pursue
  The noble and devour all things Divine.
  Look! they illustrate horrors, which prove true
      The Hell, which Milton's glimpse could not outline.

  Look! Freedom glares and pallid as a ghost,
      Except for gashes on her brow and breast,
      And faint from hunger, sits awhile to rest.
  Amphibious Barry, bold on sea or coast,
  Mounts and spurs darkness to the Tory Host,
      And, like an Indian rider with head prest
      Down to his steed's hot neck in prowess test,
  Plucks from the ground, a prize he well may boast.

  Oh, as the sun's smile passing through the rain,
      Shines forth a double arch, so, Barry's deed,
      Refleshing Freedom's bones made gaunt by need,
  Shines through the Ages; aye, and shines forth twain--
      Both for America, from Britain Freed,
      And Erin, still choked black in Britain's chain!

  With France and Erin heartening Washington,
      Prone Freedom rose, with head above the cloud.
      Beholding her transfigured, Thrall is cowed.
  His minions are bewildered. How they run!
  Some follow him against the rising sun;
      Others plod north. The Torries' vaster crowd
      Hide in dark places, and like Satan, proud,
  They hate the glory, that the true have won.

  O Milton! Thou beheldest them. Thine ear
      Caught their defiance and thy lightening pen,
      In shattering the dark in evil's den,
  Caught hope amphibious from leer to leer
      Of those grim shadows, plotting to regain
      Lost Paradise, or bane its atmosphere.

  Who loosed our land from Britain's numbing hold?
      "They who had naught to loose," the Tories say;
      That is--not menials in the King's sure pay,
  Nor mongrels, chained to guard their master's gold.
  They were True Men. Their spirit, young and bold,
      With dreams played follow-master, climbing day
      From deepest night, to catch the Sun and stay
  His glory for the World, then whiteing cold.

  Though darkness be far vaster than the lamp,
      It is the beams that lead to progress, count.
      "To manhood, with the virtues to surmount
  Such darknesses as Valley Forge's camp,
      And seas, deep hell's sky-reaching, broadening fount,
      Honor!" The ages shout on Triumph's tramp.

  When hurled from heaven, 'tis thought, the fiends of pride
      Caught Earth to brake their fall. The regions gave
      And sank with all the hosts beneath the wave!
  'Tis in those sunken regions which divide
  The new world of the resolute and brave,
      From the old world of king and abject slave,
      Where Torries, counterfeiting Satan, hide.

  Clinging, like lava, to a lifeless limb,
      They think the phosphorescence of the bark
      Is morning, which the long-belated lark
  Is hastening to welcome with his hymn;
      Else, they form poisons and breathe from the dark,
      Miasma mist to make the sun-rise dim.

  Old Guard of Boston! Halt; Right Face; Attention!
      Order One: quell the weeds in rankest riot
      Where lies Elisha Brown, in conscience, quiet.
  This Brown was John's precursor. Ye, on pension
  For ancient glory, now do duty. Mention
      Elisha's name for countersign--and why, it?
      Because with him, wrong, seen, was to defy it,
  And act, else, was beyond his comprehension.

  Against his home's invasion this man held
      A red-coat regiment for seventeen days,
      Which was a spark to help start freedom's blaze
  And, therefore, Order Two: the weeds all quelled,
  Stand sentries till a statue takes your place
      And throngs shout, "Bravo, Brown!" as 'tis unveiled!

  What is it that today we celebrate
      With school recital, banquet and parade
      Of our achievements, pageanting each trade?
  The ousting of the English--train and trait--
  And posting, then, sharp-eyed, eternal hate
      To watch with Josuah's son above his head,
      That night come not to help them re-invade,
  However wide, we swing our ocean gate.

  If not un-Englishing America in mind
      And heart forever, vain the shrieks
      Of Freedom, eagling back to dawn's first streaks.
  Oh, yea, the sun stands, and the night afar
      Holds Thrall, whose craft would swamp our noblest peaks
      And leave but bubbling mud show where they are!

  Manhatta! Glory flings his arms round thee
      And proudly holds thee in his high caress.
      What charms him, Mother, is thy nobleness
  Of spirit. How his features beam to see
  Thy scorn dash in the bay the tyrant's tea,
      And hear thee call to Boston: "Do no less;
      Else on sunlight, heart, soul--all we possess--
  Will tyrant's next exact their deadly fee."

  In thee I glory. Can the world else boast
      A harbor, like thy heart, for every sail
      In flight from sea-toss, white with horror's gale,
  Or icebergs from despondence Polar coast?
      Oh, fleets whose throngs, glad Freedom well may hail;
      For, landing, they became her staunchest host.

  With what wild glee, the British set on fire
      Yon Capital, beholding in its flames,
      America, robed in her deeds and fames,
  In death throes at the stake of England's ire?
  Though that was long ago and, then no pyre,
      The stake still stands; 'tis Anglo-Saxon claims,
      And Arnolds, bearing infamy's last names,
  Tilt schools to raise the stake flames high and higher.

  Oh, sight to strike the coming ages dead,
      My country, were a cloud, thy mocking crown,
      And schools, ignited by Truth's lamps hurled down,
  To feed that cloud, like craters, inly red!
  What! mock with cloud, Thy land and sea renown
      And Washington, God's Holy Spirit--known
      By the unerring World Light, that it shed?

  Behold Ye Here the Happy Hunting Grounds,
      Where the Great Spirit, called Democracy,
      Sets every heart and soul forever free,
  An Equity, not royal grant, sets bounds.
  No Phaeton attempting Phoebus rounds
      And burning up earth's grass and forestry,
      Is lust for power; 'tis love for liberty,
  With bloom and birds for wheel-sparks, here resounds.

  It is the land of Spirit. "Ye who enter,
      Abandon first all fratricidal hate,"
      Proclaims the edict, blazoned o'er each gate.
  There see all tribes chase truth to joy--the center
  Convexing broad and broader, as more great
      Their numbers from where prejudice is mentor.

  Hark, 'tis the sea! How leonine its roar!
      But, oh, how more the lion on a height,
      As there he glares and listens for the night,
  Having devoured day's clouds from shore to shore!
  Now grows his mane of billows, high and hoar.
      What scents he? Potencies escaping sight,
      Till, like the cold, they icily alight
  Upon a land where all was spring before.

  The sun darts under earth and east again,
      What sees he? First the lion at earth's brink
      With head down to the stream of stars to drink;
  And then, arising to his zenith ken,
  Sees that which makes his high, warm spirit sink--
      The blight to spring, blown here from England's fen.

  What is the blight to spring that kills the seed
      And raises spectres, so that stars cry "See!"
      Aghast at forests, white or shadowy?
  The scorn of human rights, that can but lead
  The world from doom to doom! and for what mead?
      A bronze for rain and rust, or effigy
      For nibbling minutes--ah, not hours!--these flee
  To life's progression--truth and kindly deed.

  Look! How this scorn holds freemen in the dark,
      Except for a flare at will that, then, the throng,
      Reduced to dust, may rise and whirl along
  The lift and drop of glitter, without spark
  To set the spring a-crackling with bird song,
      Till bud and angel both come out to hark!

  O Country of the Sun's warm plenteous hand
      To every germ of virtue, how below
      Thy progress, mope Gold Mongers to and fro,
  Who think they're vaulting from sunlight so grand,
  It forms thy chiefest glory. Closely scanned,
      They are gross worms, each with the thought to grow
      "The Conqueror," as staged by Edgar Poe
  For darking planets and a world, Last Manned.

  Those worms that, moving, think they move the earth,
      Or, under Growth's equestrian statue, think
      They hold the horse and hero from the brink,
  Are pitifully not a glance's worth,
  As of thy glory; they but foul the chink,
      If not of thee in warming Good to birth.

  How weird a whisper! 'tis from Wallabout.
      'Tis glory hoarse with calling: "Raise those hulks
      Where writhe my faithful." See! the tory skulks
  Behind the sun who, stooping to fill out
  Their throats with his god-breath, to swell the shout
      Of a free people, finds the brave in bulks,
      Strewn and held fast where Darkness, beaten, sulks
  That thrall has been forever put to rout.

  Those mangled thousands are not dead; they live,
      Refashioned men by freedom. Is the tory
      Behind the sun, to mock me, who am Glory,
  Being the lifted life those martyrs give?
  He creeps beneath the sun and, ghastly gory,
      Crys out: "Thou yet shall be the fugitive".

  Oh, weirder grows the whisper into word,
      As sharp as lightening, and as broad of reach,
      As seas, flung down by God to every beach
  Where thirsts a sparrow, or a bleating herd!
  There is no soul through out the land, not stirred;
      For, oh, to glory God gives his own speech
      When darkness, raised by Gold, declares that each,
  Hulk-held, is good but for the wolf and bird.

  Is Gold grown conscious, now the Country's King
      That, at his beck, the blood for Freedom spilt
      Shall be accursed, and I, then, for the guilt
  Of dropping not with thud, as he with ring
  At Darkness' feet, be shut in mud and silt
      Forever and with stars, cease, beaconing?

  Oh, as the earth in discord and in dark,
      When struck by Love on high with will for mace,
      Keeps rattling till each mote finds its true place,
  And mountain, fledged with groves, vies with the lark
  To reach the sunrise; so the madness stark
      Of gold, dethroning blood as God's best grace,
      When struck by Glory's voice drops Nadir-base,
  And blood for Freedom spilt, forms heaven's blue arc.

  The shouts of millions shake Oblivion's mire
      And raise Thrall's Hulks. Look! Justice's stooping sun,
      Seeing in agony's each, a Washington,
  Breaths life in them, and, over Brooklyn's spire
  And New York's Babel Tower, they, one by one,
      Hold Liberty's broading Torch of quenchless fire.

  Hate thou not any man, for at the worst,
      He still is brother. Will a glance not find
      Whole peoples alchemied from heart and mind
  To steal projectiles by a craft, accursed
  By Human Nature? Aye, for, as they burst
      At dusk, or midnight, slamming Heaven behind
      And crashing Hell wide open, 'tis mankind
  Is shattered and quick-gulping grave slake thirst.

  Hate thou no man, but scorn all crafts, that smelt
      The heart and mind for huge projectiles, shattered
      When bursting grandly that some pride be flattered.
  Nature beholds not Saxon, Slav, nor Celt;
  She only sees the Human fragments scattered,
      And, covering them, her eyes to rivers melt.

  O Freedom! Have I ever been untrue?
      When, to thy moan of hunger anywhere,
      Have I been deaf? Was I not quick to share
  My little, nay, give all! for oh! I knew
  Thy beauty, and my love such passion grew
      At thy distresses,--What would I not dare!
      So, though the bellow, like a grizzly bear,
  Reared up before me, on to thee I flew.

  O Freedom! Is thy beauty without heart,
      Or sense of justice? Unto whom art thou
      Indebted for thine arm, encircling now
  The world, sun-like, more than to me? My part
  I glory in, for I have kept my vow.
      I hold thee now to thine, if true thou art.

  Speak Freedom! When a haggard fugitive,
      Thy dwelling was a swamp, who first to trace
      Thy crimson footprints to thy hiding place?
  With signs thou hadst not many days to live,
  I found thee. Had the sun more heart to give
      To warm thee, than I gave? Ah, then and there
      Thy heart said to my heart; "Ill would I fare
  Without thee. I give love for love, believe".

  Thy silence, when in glory, troubles me.
      Oh! warm blood dashed back cold, chills to the bone!
      What do I ask for? Only Erin's own,
  That which God gave her, and, if true it be,
  Thou art the minister of justice grown,
      Thy gratitude should thunder God's decree.

  What! Why bemoan one island in the sea,
      When I can range like mountains, or, the sun,
      Above all clouds, and, rosy from my run
  To God, like morn, chant praise, since flesh of thee?
  Oh, yea, my pride and transport, verily,
      Is, thou and I eternally are one;
      And this god-passion which no power can stun,
  I owe to her, who gave her soul to me.

  Oh, when I see her golden hair, adrift
      On sorrow's sea, like weeds rent from their reef,
      And know she breathes with her sublime belief,
  It crazes me that thou, when thou mightst lift
  Her saintly features, and dry them of grief,
      Wads't not, but waitest for the tide to shift.

  America! 'Tis not thy mines of gold,
      Nor streams from mounts to meadows, like God's hand
      From out the heavens, a-flash across the land
  In long, deep sweeps to quicken winter's mould
  To reaps of ripeness,--that mine eyes behold,
      Invoking thee; for these are mere shore-sand
      To the broad ocean of thy spirit grand,
  Forming for man a new world for the old.

  'Tis Liberty, to whose most blessed birth
      The stars all lead, rejoicing, which souls thee
      With God's compassion for humanity,--
  That I invoke; and, now, when all the earth
  Bears palms and chants hosannas--what! shall she,
      The most devout, be shut from Freedom's mirth?

  All English glory is in "Kipling's Boots."
      O English People! read that poem true,
      And answer,--are those maddening men not you?
  Oh, not yea few, who gather all the loots,
  But yea vast legions, lured to be recruits
      To march, march, march and march with naught in view
      But boots, boots, boots with blood and mud soaked through,--
  And, after ages, with out rest, or fruits!

  "Boots, boots, boots, and no discharge from war,"--
      That is the Empire's anthem. Brass it out,
      Ye Orchestras! But oh, leave not in doubt
  Its import, Kipling,--that 'tis maelstrom roar--
  'Tis England's streams of home-life, world about
      And down a gulf, for Greed and Pride on shore!

  If deaf to Shelley's loudest sky-lark strain,
      His rage at tyrants, and to Byron's thong,
      Nerve-proof, how wake the English to the wrong
  Done their true selves, no less than to the slain,
  When willing weapons for Ambition's gain?
      Aye, weapons only; for, to whom belong
      The minds of England, and treed fields of song--
  Nay, all but grave-ground, grudged by hill and plain?

  O English People, whom the crafty class
      Has huddled into graves from sight and sound
      Of what God hands you, and, with pence, or pound,
  Lids down your wild dead stare,--wake! why so crass?
  See in the Celts spring-burst from underground,
      The Human Resurrection come to pass.

  Oh, what are England's lines of lords and kings,
      Shakespeare, to thine, a-throb with thought and feeling?
      In thine, imagination shines, revealing
  The soul's convictions, swift on dawn-ward wings
  From beastly life and such Hell-smelling things,
      As wealth and pomp from church and abbey stealing,--
      And hearts in hopes high Belfries, Heavenward pealing,
  As Time, his Sun and Starry censor, swings.

  Would thou wert England's Nature, Bard Supreme,
      To fashion kings and lordlings fit to rule;
      They would be flesh and blood, not fiend and ghoul;
  And would thou wert her Sun, that every beam
  Might not, for tally, show a youth's blood-pool,
      Choking blithe Spring, as, now, to earth's extreme.

  The righteousness of England! "Tis to kneel
      Full weight on weaker nations, and entone
      Hosannas louder than the victims groan;
  Then, stooping, drink their blood with gulps of zeal."
  What right have wounds, though wide, to throb, or feel?
      'Tis blasphemy to England's crimson throne.
      Knee-deep in Erin's blood, she mocks Christ's moan:
  Forgive them, Lord! they know not their true weal.

  "Whose is the fault? Tis not my arrogance,
      But candor, Lord, that puts the blame on Thee.
      What right hadst Thou to make these people free
  And let all nature prompt them to advance?--
  Oh, no such blunder, Lord, hadst Thou called me,
      Instead of Wisdom, to approve Thy plans!"

  The Bard's curse: "Ruin seize thee Ruthless King,"
      Took bat-like form for hollow echo-flight.
      Though stoned and lanced at, when, at fall of night,
  It darted forth with ghastly--spreading wing,
  It found in fresh, wide, royal ravishing,
      New hollows, dark with horror and sad plight,
      To dash in and live on. Oh, to my sight,
  How grows its grimness, while eternaling!

  Deep are the minds of Wales, but far more deep
      The horror, gulfed out by McCreedy, firing
      On men defenseless and, through want, expiring.
  Oh, from that gulf the Bard's curse makes a sweep
  Up to the Sun and, from its long desiring,
      Grown eagle, shrieks to heaven from steep to step!

  "A dirty work," said Dyer, rebuked for spilling
      Hundreds of lives to irrigate new lands.
      A dirty work, but not for British hands,
  Dabbling in blood to earn each day their shilling.
  Hark! Mohawk Valley and Wyoming, chilling
      With thought of Tarleton's King-serving bands,
      And Canada red-clayed, though high snow stands,
  Cry: Work for which the British are too willing!

  Invaded lands need terror irrigation
      To make them fruitful. Better flood the field,
      Then let the native bloom become the yield;
  And, so, this Dyer submerged a small whole nation
  With crimson death, that England might, deep-keeled,
      Have for display, new seas of desolation.

  The ocean, holding pure the azure's blue,
      Laughs at the tempests, with one empire's dust
      After an other, to round out Earth's crust.
  Ah, so does Human Nature hold the hue
  It takes from heaven, its conscience, and laughs, too,
      At madness, wrecking life and with its gust
      Forming new islands, where Pride, Greed, or Lust,
  Welcomes the crater's glare, in sun-light's lieu.

  Look in the sea and deep, what scattered rock,
      The islands which at dusk, the tempest piled!
      Ere rose a star, they sank with crews, beguiled.
  O Tempests that with world formations, mock
  The good Creator, how, as ye grow wild,
      Earth quakes and no live thing survives the shock.

  Our country is not rock and wood and stream,
      But soul transfusing them. What is the soul?
      The substance, born of God, above control
  And, when one, with God's love, called "Will," supreme;
  And Freedom is the soul in thought, and dream
      That Nature's beauty and harmonious whole--
      God's foot-steps--followed, life attains its Goal;
  And soul is purpose to achieve God's scheme.

  The soul, then,--our true country,--is the brave
      Who fought and bled for Freedom, or will fight
      To their last pulse, last breath, for Human Right.----
  Great soul! oh, how like bubbles in the wave,
  Are the Sierras in cerulean flight,
      To thy true grandeur, letting nought enslave!

  O thou art Character--art only those
      Who formed the good and great by thought, or deed.
      All others are not worth a moment's heed,--
  Mere prairie dogs, who raise gold hills in rows--
  When gazing at thy glory; for that grows
      With Freedom from all foul untruths; with lead
      In art for weal; with science for all woes;
  With hate of thrall and help for all unfreed.

  No mere foot-shadow, on time's wall, art thou,
      Without eye-sparkle, swing of arm, warm flow
      From heart to vain, and cheeks with health of glow.
  Oh, 'tis eternal heights reflect thy brow
  And shoulders, that avert man's overthrow,
      Threatened all times, and never more than now.

  Oh, what if lone and long thy lofty flight,
      My country? Is thy vision not as clear
      As that of Vesper, dauntless pioneer
  On Twilight's altitude? As from that height,
  He sees plain through the thick black walls of night,
      The stars all massing; so dost thou, his peer,
      Behold all peoples gathering, year by year,
  To scale the clouds to thy White Range of Right.

  How thy lone loftness, aloof from wrong,
      Refracting man-ward, God's enrapturing smile
      Of fruitful fields, leads legions! On they file
  And phalanx, and the vision makes thee strong:
  What, though God's searchlight flares the sky the while?
      It nears not thee, ear-close to heaven's high song.

  From out a desert where the trails run red,
      Judah and Erin speed their camel pace,
      Sighting green palms. The flush on either face
  Is from the fissure where each wedged her head
  From sandstorms, that hurled heavens down, as they sped;
      It is no blush for thought, or conduct, base
      To the high trust to bring the Human Race,
  Truths, without which Time's offspring are born dead.

  In spirit, they are sisters; for, beyond
      The desert, where the vision, like a dove,
      Soars round the palace of Almighty Love,
  God hails them as "My Daughters, true and fond,
  Who show man, through Noon blaze, my star above,
      And to my will, fail never to respond."

  Who, in descent from Heaven's ecstatic throng,
      Was twin to light, and ranged from source to sea,
      And shore to peak, and God, drew up to thee
  The generations happy, pure and strong?
  Freedom, as Erin's was, ere ruthless wrong
      Caught, scourged and hanged it on the out-law's tree;
      And is; for lo! it proves Divinity,
  Transfiguring from anguish, ages long.

  True, they have strangled Freedom on the cross
      Of every Right's suppression--nay, have barred
      His body's tomb, and placed a host on guard!
  Still, He is risen; His faithful mourn no loss.
  He shines forth in their midst. No bolts retard
      His entrance, where grand aims for life engross.

  The fight in Ireland is 'twixt Man and Brute.
      A lion with the sea-surge for his mane,
      Is there hurled back by Man with proud disdain,
  Although heart-drained with gash from head to foot.
  Oh, in that Eden of Forbidden Fruit,
      How Satan, searching for a snake in vain,
      Fumed forth a monster from his heart and brain--
  The Lion--as the serpent's substitute!

  Oh, all ye peoples of the World draw nigh!
      Stand on the bodies of eight centuries,
      Struck dead with horror; for, raised thus, one sees
  In Erin, torn, a soul that cannot die,
  And that its struggle is Humanity's
      Against the fiend, who would give God the lie.

  How help take pride in thee, whose golden hair
      Of culture trailed the earth for centuries;
      Whose throne was freedom and whose realm was peace;
  And, in strange lands, whose joy and only care
  Were to spread light, and who, not anywhere
      Thy charm made headway, planting liberties,
      Didst, then, by stealthy step, or creep on knees,
  Sow with the lilies, faster-growing tare!

  How help love thee, whose hand, raised to the sun,
      Glows rosy, and not red with murder's stain?
      The angels kiss it. Force can forge no chain
  To drag thee false-ward. Like a holy Nun,
  Stigmated, how thy faith grows with thy pain--
      Aye, till thy Cross, like Constantine's has won.

  In rapt, roused Erin, who does not behold
      A Venus, rising from the sea of tears,
      Up to her native, Earth-illuming spheres?
  Her hair, long matted, is a flow of gold
  Which even the Sun might wear and feel not cold;
      And, oh, her heavenly smile at doubts and fears,
      As when she, at all depths, raised to her ears,
  Shells of her Glory, murmuring, "Be bold!"

  Lo! where the green and orange morn unfurls,
      See Erin rise. How shine her golden tresses!
      They form her crown, for trailing rocks down whirls,
  And reaching all the under-sea recesses,
  They draw about her brow, the rarest pearls--
      Love for what frees and hate for what oppresses!

  All hail to those who, through the stormy night,
      Make Liberty the light on Erin's coast;
      Who, ceaseless, send up sparks; who hold their post
  On each and every ledge of Human Right,
  Forming a beacon blaze from base to height
      Where Erin's hope may steer and land its host.
      Look, Human Nature! Where else canst thou boast
  To the eternal stars, so grand a sight?

  Look! How men there ennoble human kind
      By making Liberty the light to Peace!
      All other lights are false. Oh! who but sees
  In the unconquerable Celtic mind
  That, even in Time, there are Eternities--
      Love, true to Right, and Will no wrong can bind!

  Why play with words? There never can be peace
      Till Ireland is set free. One might as well
      Expect the great Arch-angel rest in Hell
  And genuflect to Satan's blasphemies,
  As Erin's spirit that, for centuries,
      Has been aloft with God in virtue, sell,
      Like Esaw, her birthright, and not rebel,
  But to her home's invaders, bend her knees.

  Her spirit is no norbury Banshee--
      To wail and, then, to vanish. She will stand
      With lifted flambeau, lighted by the hand
  That lights the stars, till she again is free,
  Inspiring normal man in every land
      With love of Freedom, by her scorn of thee.

  Look! British fury that, barraging, lights
      Up Irish skies, like pathways down to hell,
      Doubles its fire to reach our land as well,
  Where Freedom's Wardens cry from justice' heights:
  "'Tis Deicide to murder Human Rights.
      Stop foul God-slaughter where to not rebel,
      In order to develop and excel,
  Were God in man, succumbed to age-longed blights."

  Where Heavenward rose the God in man of old,
      Staunch stand these Wardens. Sleepless, they behold
      Each turn of England's Evil Eye. They call,
  When she would form the fulminate of gold,
  A thumb and finger-pinch of which, let fall,
      Might blast Columbia's peaks to slit of thrall.

  Of all the fulminates, gold is the worst,
      Which England, aeroplaning, now, lets drop
      By day and night, in bank, press, church and shop,
  Timed to the minute that it is to burst.
  List to Demosthenes, if not to Hearst,
      Sublime Republic! Lest thy great heart stop,
      Shocked by the blast of Freedom's every prop,
  And bats and owls in dwellings, Human's erst.

  "Watch Macedon. She drops her gold, in creeping
      Beneath free Athens' sky-ascending stair.
      Watch her with glance of sword. Oh, watch, for where
  She sows her gold, she comes with scythes for reaping!
  Is Athens in ascent with sun-light flare,
      To come down ashes, not worth history's keeping?"

  In only Wallace and Paul Jones and Burns,
      Does Caledonia, child of Erin, show
      His mother's features, lit by soul to know
  The Right Divine of freedom, when it yearns
  For what exalts the human, or, it spurns
      What bars its flight to truth--all stars aglow,
      That form God's trail to joy for man below?--
  Sole trail, as time, who peers through grief, discerns.

  O Caledonia, by thy Burn's brave song,
      And deeds of Wallace and Paul Jones for Right,
      Thy mother knows thee in the dark of night,
  And claps thee heart-close. She cries out: "Be strong,
  Soul of my soul! though not a Boswell quite,
      Still, be whole man! remember Glencoe's wrong."

  Wake, Caledonia! though Macauley, Whigging,
      Would ward the flames from scarring William's face,
      So that, then, Cain might shriek,--here, take my place,
  A fugitive and outcast, with no digging
  To hide in, nor a rest for my fatiguing;
      The mark on me, is but God's finger trace;
      On you, 'tis God's whole hand!--Still, there's the blaze!
  There's England's soul of merciless intriguing!

  List! 'tis the bagpipes welcoming the guest.
      See the assembly, dance and feast. Oh, watch
      The open heart and flow of good old Scotch;
  The English come, as friends, must have the best.
  There, hospitality is at top notch,--
      And so is treachery in Britain's breast.

  The cock crows.--Is he dreaming? 'Tis dark still.
      He crows again and now, from farm to farm,
      His fellows echo far his dazed alarm
  And flap of wings on fences. He is shrill
  Because it is not dawn above the hill,
      That wakes him, but the English, as they arm,
      And murder sleep, that has no dream of harm,
  In couch and crib,--to further England's will.

  O Caledonia! with such lamp in hand
      As Glencoe's horror, thou hast England true.
      Why let Froude fiction haze thy vivid view?
  Put not thy light out for sound sleep, but stand
  And answer, when the mother, whom thou drew
      Thy soul from, cries "Glencoe"! when Black and Taned.

  O Canada, Long red with cottage flame
      From Britain's torch! thy blasts milk not the cloud
      To nourish hope; instead, they spread the shroud
  On Human Spirit answering Freedom's claim.
  Whence comes the cold which icicles with shame,
      Thy heart's Niagara, that should thunder loud
      Unto thy far off soul in sorrow, bowed
  O'er Papineau, whom Thraldom could not tame?

  Now following the Friends, who grandly led
      The slave through tunnels to the Northern Star,
      To find, in freedom, richer bloomage far,
  Than the Magnolia o'er the cattle shed,--
  I reach thy soul,--where now the Crawfords are,
      And learn the cold is not from manhood dead.

  Whence comes this cold to Freedom's claim? we know
      Only too well,--from creatures of the King,
      Who had dragged Hell of every poisonous thing
  And, through our country, had spread waste and woe.
  Beaten at last, they flocked like carion crow,
      On the dead body of their will to sting,
      Which drifting Northward, and enlargening,
  Loomed Dante's Nimrod, 'mid the Arctic snow.

  There, with the reptile's hate of Man Upright,
      As God created him, and reptiles veins,
      Aflow with deaths cold blood--for that sustains
  The life of tyrant and of parasite--
  This monster, though half sunk in Hell, remains
      High, still, above the Arctic's shuddering night.

  The monster's inhalations empty Hell
      Of all deterents to Life's flow and flower;
      Then, its outbreathings icily devour
  The cataract in flight and, down the dell,
  The streamlets to delight, and buds, as well,
      Of virtue, forming bloom for Freedom's bower;--
      Nay, its out breathings,--through Creed hatred's power--
  Grow Boreus and face where freeman dwell.

  Lo! with Sun-warmth for Truth and Human Right,
      Is Boreus met. Who hurles him down the deep?
      Look close;--'tis Gladden who, on Freedom's steep,
  Is as inspiring, as, on Andes' height,
  The great Christ Statue, bidding Rancor sleep
      And Life's diverging rays in love, beam Light.

  The cataracts wild leap, turned glittering ice
      In shame's suspension, and crow souls afeeding
      Upon a huge dead body and fast breeding,--
  Is, as a scene, not worth the railroad's price;
  But, oh, if, with "Excelsior" for device,
      Thou climb thy Alpine way, each day exceeding
      The other's height, what throngs would watch thy speeding
  And, for the thrill thou woulds't give them, come twice!

  O Canada! why all this sleigh-bell rhyming?
      'Tis on the reindeer, hope, in speed with me
      To the grand morning, when thou shalt breathe free
  Upon the apex of thine Alpine climbing,
  From foulsome, choaking smells of tyranny,
      Thick from the Great Sea Serpent's inland sliming.

  God said to Wrong: "No further shalt thou go."
      This, Monroe heard and held, then, in his heart.
      It was this he repeated, when on chart
  He made his markings, checking Freedom's foe.
  God never grants to Wrong the right to grow;
      Because He sets its bounds, does not impart
      His blessing on its growth, more than its start;
  His blessing goes to Right, to overthrow.

  Oh, let thine eyes for migratory flight
      Speed southward! Passing Prejudice's Lake,
      Green-crusted with stagnation which some take
  For verdure, they will see from Andes' height,
  How Freedom's battle forms the red day-break,
      And tides are swells from thrall, hurled deep from sight.

  Thine eyes returning from the Southern Cross,
      Will, when like Perry, they have reached the Pole,
      Search under it to find thy banished soul,
  O Canada, and tell it of thy loss
  In letting a foul dead body, which the moss
      Of the deep sea should hide, loom as thy whole
      And rule, as dead things rule, with death for toll,
  As pierced by Papineau through Glamor's gloss.

  From South to North, no sky is black but thine.
      Thy fecund brain, the Borealis, shows
      A swaying disc with shades of dark for glows,
  With but a faint salt smell of Color's brine,
  The pent-up billows in the disc's dark close,
      Which might flood midnight with rare, world-wide shine.

  We seek no annexation, but of Mind,
      Heart, Spirit. True, thy clear, sonorous voice
      At Freedom's class-call, would make us rejoice,
  For, then, close-coasting thrall would fail to find
  In the new world, one truant to mankind,
      Swimming out to the foreigners' decoys,
      Or fast asleep amid his infant toys,
  Instead of at the task, which God assigned.

  Oh, let thy spirit come, but it must be
      Along the star-way to the rising sun--
      The way of love; not down creed hates that run,
  Like broken stone-steps, to a roaring sea--
  The way thou oft, hast come. Rise, and be one
      On the new world's Star-top of Liberty.

  "The Angels come in dreams," says Holy Writ;
      And Science says, "No sleep so deep, but dreams."
      Devine appearances with brightening gleams
  Toward Paradise up from the demon's pit,
  Ever rouse virtue; aye, for God redeems
      His fire, wherever hid; the tempest teems,
      But still his sparks fly, quick as flint is hit.

  Wake, Canada! and let thy Papineaus
      Be dreams remembered; yea, let them inspire
      Thy life to follow Freedom high and higher
  Through Rights' whole range of summits, crowned with snows
  Sparkling from star-moulds of the Soul's desire,
      On earth from Heaven where, clouds from flames, they rose.

  O Freedom! whose pure soul and heart embrace
      Translates me into heaven, I draw for breath
      The joy of angels who have not known death.
  Child-like, I look up in thy loving face,
  Else gaze around and point, and curious place
      My hand on Mottoes, hung on high. One saith:
      "Beware, for he not with me scatterith."
  Its meaning comes to me with growth, like grace.

  Ah, as a youngster, on its mother's arm,
      Seeing a hideous thing approaching night,
      Will not lay down its head and shut its eye,
  But will with look and lung express alarm--
  My mind cries out in dread--when sea and sky
      Show dragons, tendencies that work thee harm.

  O Freedom! Up to whose raised hand the seas
      Leap, playful lions, or with head and main
      Across their paws lie couchant--it is pain
  To see thee whose heart beats are God's decrees,
  And vital breathings are infinities,
      Now check thy heart and hold thy breath to gain
      The smile and plaudit of a depths with bane
  In finger tips, while fawning on their knees.

  What! Think the tyrant, whose great soul is trade,
      Whose history, a crater, belching black
      And lurid, keeps glad Easter morning back
  From half the world--loves thee save to invade,
      As blackward planned? loves thee, along whose track
      March Human rights up to the stars parade?

  There where the Tyrant long has loomed, wreck-crowned,
      Are young and old hurled to the coast and blast.
      Frail are their ships; still, Sun, why glare aghast,
  Watching the billows monstering around?
  The soul of man was not born to be drowned.
      It mounts and mounts, till, at God's throne, at last,
      And freedom welcomes it with arms, sky-vast,
  As down it comes to meet Thrall and confound.

  O, deathless spirit, born of hosts sea-hurled,
      Who hast out soared night's stars with agony's cry
      For justice! Thou hast come down from the sky,
  Heralding doom to Thrall, whose flag unfurled
  By steel, or craft, shows, as 'tis hoisted high,
      The blood of man and ruin of the world.

  What is the Truth? The thought, the act, or cry,
      Recasting the Supreme Intelligence;
      All else is false. Look! where are stars so dense,
  That each has not the freedom of the sky?
  And, still, what peace, what glory, reigns on high!
      What! with the wisdom of the heavens, dispense?
      The Peace, for which our longings grow intense,
  Comes through the stars to earth, and but thereby.

  In the mountains, there you feel free.
  I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
  Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man,                                  
  You cannot say, or guess, for you know only
  A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,
  And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief,
  And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
  There is shadow under this red rock,
  (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),
  And I will show you something different from either
  Your shadow at morning striding behind you
  Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;
  I will show you fear in a handful of dust.                              
       _Frisch weht der Wind
       Der Heimat zu
       Mein Irisch Kind,
       Wo weilest du?_
  “You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
  “They called me the hyacinth girl.”
  —Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
  Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
  Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
  Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,                                    
  Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
  _Oed’ und leer das Meer_.

  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
  Had a bad cold, nevertheless
  Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
  With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she,
  Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor,
  (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!)
  Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks,
  The lady of situations.                                                 
  Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel,
  And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card,
  Which is blank, is something he carries on his back,
  Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find
  The Hanged Man. Fear death by water.
  I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.
  Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,
  Tell her I bring the horoscope myself:
  One must be so careful these days.

  Unreal City,                                                            
  Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,
  A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,
  I had not thought death had undone so many.
  Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,
  And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.
  Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,
  To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours
  With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.
  There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying “Stetson!
  “You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!                            
  “That corpse you planted last year in your garden,
  “Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?
  “Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?
  “Oh keep the Dog far hence, that’s friend to men,
  “Or with his nails he’ll dig it up again!
  “You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!”    
      
  The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne,
  Glowed on the marble, where the glass
  Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines
  From which a golden Cupidon peeped out                                  
  (Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
  Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra
  Reflecting light upon the table as
  The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
  From satin cases poured in rich profusion.
  In vials of ivory and coloured glass
  Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
  Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
  And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
  That freshened from the window, these ascended                          
  In fattening the prolonged candle-flames,
  Flung their smoke into the laquearia,
  Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling.
  Huge sea-wood fed with copper
  Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,
  In which sad light a carvèd dolphin swam.
  Above the antique mantel was displayed
  As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene
  The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king
  So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale                             
  Filled all the desert with inviolable voice
  And still she cried, and still the world pursues,
  “Jug Jug” to dirty ears.
  And other withered stumps of time
  Were told upon the walls; staring forms
  Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.
  Footsteps shuffled on the stair.
  Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair
  Spread out in fiery points
  Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.                        

  When Lil’s husband got demobbed, I said—
  I didn’t mince my words, I said to her myself,                          
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
  Now Albert’s coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
  He’ll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
  To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
  You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
  He said, I swear, I can’t bear to look at you.
  And no more can’t I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
  He’s been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
  And if you don’t give it him, there’s others will, I said.
  Oh is there, she said. Something o’ that, I said.                       
  Then I’ll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
  If you don’t like it you can get on with it, I said.
  Others can pick and choose if you can’t.
  But if Albert makes off, it won’t be for lack of telling.
  You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
  (And her only thirty-one.)
  I can’t help it, she said, pulling a long face,
  It’s them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
  (She’s had five already, and nearly died of young George.)              
  The chemist said it would be all right, but I’ve never been the same.
  You _are_ a proper fool, I said.
  Well, if Albert won’t leave you alone, there it is, I said,
  What you get married for if you don’t want children?
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
  Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
  And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
  HURRY UP PLEASE IT’S TIME
  Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight.

  Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.    
      
  The river’s tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
  Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
  Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
  Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
  The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
  Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
  Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
  And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;               
  Departed, have left no addresses.
  By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . .
  Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song,
  Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long.
  But at my back in a cold blast I hear
  The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
  A rat crept softly through the vegetation
  Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
  While I was fishing in the dull canal
  On a winter evening round behind the gashouse                           
  Musing upon the king my brother’s wreck
  And on the king my father’s death before him.
  White bodies naked on the low damp ground
  And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
  Rattled by the rat’s foot only, year to year.
  But at my back from time to time I hear
  The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring
  Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring.
  O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
  And on her daughter                                                     
  They wash their feet in soda water

  Twit twit twit
  Jug jug jug jug jug jug
  So rudely forc’d.
  Tereu

  Unreal City
  Under the brown fog of a winter noon
  Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant
  Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants                                
  C.i.f. London: documents at sight,
  Asked me in demotic French
  To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
  Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.

  At the violet hour, when the eyes and back
  Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits
  Like a taxi throbbing waiting,
  I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives,
  Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see
  At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives                      
  Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea,
  The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights
  Her stove, and lays out food in tins.
  Out of the window perilously spread
  Her drying combinations touched by the sun’s last rays,
  On the divan are piled (at night her bed)
  Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.
  I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs
  Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest—
  I too awaited the expected guest.                                       
  He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
  A small house agent’s clerk, with one bold stare,
  One of the low on whom assurance sits
  As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire.
  The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
  The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
  Endeavours to engage her in caresses
  Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
  Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
  Exploring hands encounter no defence;                                   
  His vanity requires no response,
  And makes a welcome of indifference.
  (And I Tiresias have foresuffered all
  Enacted on this same divan or bed;
  I who have sat by Thebes below the wall
  And walked among the lowest of the dead.)
  Bestows one final patronising kiss,
  And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .

  She turns and looks a moment in the glass,
  Hardly aware of her departed lover;                                   
  Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass:
  “Well now that’s done: and I’m glad it’s over.”
  When lovely woman stoops to folly and
  Paces about her room again, alone,
  She smooths her hair with automatic hand,
  And puts a record on the gramophone.

  “This music crept by me upon the waters”
  And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street.
  O City city, I can sometimes hear
  Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street,                            
  The pleasant whining of a mandoline
  And a clatter and a chatter from within
  Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls
  Of Magnus Martyr hold
  Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.

  “Trams and dusty trees.
  Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew
  Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees
  Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe.”

  “My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart
  Under my feet. After the event
  He wept. He promised ‘a new start’.
  I made no comment. What should I resent?”
  “On Margate Sands.                                                      
  I can connect
  Nothing with nothing.
  The broken fingernails of dirty hands.
  My people humble people who expect
  Nothing.”
 
  Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
  Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
  And the profit and loss.
                                           A current under sea
  Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
  He passed the stages of his age and youth
  Entering the whirlpool.
                                         Gentile or Jew
  O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,                          
  Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.    
 
  After the torchlight red on sweaty faces
  After the frosty silence in the gardens
  After the agony in stony places
  The shouting and the crying
  Prison and palace and reverberation
  Of thunder of spring over distant mountains
  He who was living is now dead
  We who were living are now dying
  With a little patience                                                  
  Here is no water but only rock
  Rock and no water and the sandy road
  The road winding above among the mountains
  Which are mountains of rock without water
  If there were water we should stop and drink
  Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think
  Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand
  If there were only water amongst the rock
  Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit
  Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit                              
  There is not even silence in the mountains
  But dry sterile thunder without rain
  There is not even solitude in the mountains
  But red sullen faces sneer and snarl
  From doors of mudcracked houses
  
  If there were water
  And no rock
  If there were rock
  And also water
  And water                                                               
  A spring
  A pool among the rock
  If there were the sound of water only
  Not the cicada
  And dry grass singing
  But sound of water over a rock
  Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees
  Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop
  But there is no water

  Who is the third who walks always beside you?
  When I count, there are only you and I together                         
  But when I look ahead up the white road
  There is always another one walking beside you
  Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded
  I do not know whether a man or a woman
  —But who is that on the other side of you?

  What is that sound high in the air
  Murmur of maternal lamentation
  Who are those hooded hordes swarming
  Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth
  Ringed by the flat horizon only                                         
  What is the city over the mountains
  Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air
  Falling towers
  Jerusalem Athens Alexandria
  Vienna London
  Unreal

  A woman drew her long black hair out tight
  And fiddled whisper music on those strings
  And bats with baby faces in the violet light
  Whistled, and beat their wings                                       
  And crawled head downward down a blackened wall
  And upside down in air were towers
  Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours
  And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.

  In this decayed hole among the mountains
  In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing
  Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel
  There is the empty chapel, only the wind’s home.
  It has no windows, and the door swings,
  Dry bones can harm no one.                                              
  Only a cock stood on the rooftree
  Co co rico co co rico
  In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust
  Bringing rain

  Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves
  Waited for rain, while the black clouds
  Gathered far distant, over Himavant.
  The jungle crouched, humped in silence.
  Then spoke the thunder
                                                                       
  what have we given?
  My friend, blood shaking my heart
  The awful daring of a moment’s surrender
  Which an age of prudence can never retract
  By this, and this only, we have existed
  Which is not to be found in our obituaries
  Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider
  Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor
  In our empty rooms
                                                                       
  I have heard the key
  Turn in the door once and turn once only
  We think of the key, each in his prison
  Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison
  Only at nightfall, aetherial rumours
  Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus
  
  The boat responded
  Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar
  The sea was calm, your heart would have responded                       
  Gaily, when invited, beating obedient
  To controlling hands

                                       I sat upon the shore
  Fishing, with the arid plain behind me
  Shall I at least set my lands in order?
  London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down
  _Poi s’ascose nel foco che gli affina
  Quando fiam ceu chelidon_ — O swallow swallow
  _Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie_
  These fragments I have shored against my ruins                          
  Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo’s mad againe.

The little toy dog is covered with dust,
  But sturdy and stanch he stands;
And the little toy soldier is red with rust,
  And his musket molds in his hands.
Time was when the little toy dog was new
  And the soldier was passing fair,
And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue
  Kissed them and put them there.

"Now, don't you go till I come," he said,
  "And don't you make any noise!"
So toddling off to his trundle-bed
  He dreamed of the pretty toys.
And as he was dreaming, an angel song
  Awakened our Little Boy Blue,--
Oh, the years are many, the years are long,
  But the little toy friends are true.

Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,
  Each in the same old place,
Awaiting the touch of a little hand,
  The smile of a little face.
And they wonder, as waiting these long years through,
  In the dust of that little chair,
What has become of our Little Boy Blue
  Since he kissed them and put them there.

At Madge, ye hoyden, gossips scofft,
  Ffor that a romping wench was shee--
"Now marke this rede," they bade her oft,
  "Forsooken sholde your folly bee!"
But Madge, ye hoyden, laught & cried,
  "Oho, oho," in girlish glee,
And noe thing mo replied.

No griffe she had nor knew no care,
  But gayly rompit all daies long,
And, like ye brooke that everywhere
  Goes jinking with a gladsome song,
Shee danct and songe from morn till night,--
  Her gentil harte did know no wrong,
Nor did she none despight.

Sir Tomas from his noblesse halle
  Did trend his path a somer's daye,
And to ye hoyden he did call
  And these ffull evill words did say:
"O wolde you weare a silken gown
  And binde your haire with ribands gay?
Then come with me to town!"

But Madge, ye hoyden, shoke her head,--
  "I'le be no lemman unto thee
For all your golde and gownes," shee said,
  "ffor Robin hath bespoken mee."
Then ben Sir Tomas sore despight,
  And back unto his hall went hee
With face as ashen white.

"O Robin, wilt thou wed this girl,
  Whenas she is so vaine a sprite?"
So spak ffull many an envious churle
  Unto that curteyse countrie wight.
But Robin did not pay no heede;
  And they ben wed a somer night
& danct upon ye meade.

Then scarse ben past a yeare & daye
  Whan Robin toke unto his bed,
And long, long time therein he lay,
  Nor colde not work to earn his bread;
in soche an houre, whan times ben sore,
  Sr. Tomas came with haughtie tread
& knockit at ye doore.

Saies: "Madge, ye hoyden, do you know
  how that you once despighted me?
But He forgiff an you will go
  my swete harte lady ffor to bee!"
But Madge, ye hoyden, heard noe more,--
  straightway upon her heele turnt shee,
& shote ye cottage doore.

Soe Madge, ye hoyden, did her parte
  whiles that ye years did come and go;
't was somer allwais in her harte,
  tho' winter strewed her head with snowe.
She toilt and span thro' all those years
  nor bid repine that it ben soe,
nor never shad noe teares.

Whiles Robin lay within his bed,
  A divell came and whispered lowe,--
"Giff you will doe my will," he said,
  "None more of sickness you shall knowe!"
Ye which gave joy to Robin's soul--
  Saies Robin: "Divell, be it soe,
an that you make me whoale!"

That day, upp rising ffrom his bed,
  Quoth Robin: "I am well again!"
& backe he came as from ye dead,
  & he ben mickle blithe as when
he wooed his doxy long ago;
  & Madge did make ado & then
Her teares ffor joy did flowe.

Then came that hell-born cloven thing--
  Saies: "Robin, I do claim your life,
and I hencefoorth shall be your king,
  and you shall do my evill strife.
Look round about and you shall see
  sr. Tomas' young and ffoolish wiffe--
a comely dame is shee!"

Ye divell had him in his power,
  and not colde Robin say thereto:
Soe Robin from that very houre
  did what that divell bade him do;
He wooed and dipt, and on a daye
  Sr. Tomas' wife and Robin flewe
a many leagues away.

Sir Tomas ben wood wroth and swore,
  And sometime strode thro' leaf & brake
and knockit at ye cottage door
  and thus to Madge, ye hoyden, spake:
Saies, "I wolde have you ffor mine own,
  So come with mee & bee my make,
syn tother birds ben flown."

But Madge, ye hoyden, bade him noe;
  Saies: "Robin is my swete harte still,
And, tho' he doth despight me soe,
  I mean to do him good for ill.
So goe, Sir Tomas, goe your way;
  ffor whiles I bee on live I will
ffor Robin's coming pray!"

Soe Madge, ye hoyden, kneelt & prayed
  that Godde sholde send her Robin backe.
And tho' ye folke vast scoffing made,
  and tho' ye worlde ben colde and blacke,
And tho', as moneths dragged away,
  ye hoyden's harte ben like to crack
With griff, she still did praye.

Sicke of that divell's damnèd charmes,
  Aback did Robin come at last,
And Madge, ye hoyden, sprad her arms
  and gave a cry and held him fast;
And as she clong to him and cried,
  her patient harte with joy did brast,
& Madge, ye hoyden, died.

Hush, bonnie, dinna greit;
Moder will rocke her sweete,--
    Balow, my boy!
When that his toile ben done,
Daddie will come anone,--
Hush thee, my lyttel one;
    Balow, my boy!

Gin thou dost sleepe, perchaunce
Fayries will come to daunce,--
    Balow, my boy!
Oft hath thy moder seene
Moonlight and mirkland queene
Daunce on thy slumbering een,--
    Balow, my boy!

Then droned a bomblebee
Saftly this songe to thee:
    "Balow, my boy!"
And a wee heather bell,
Pluckt from a fayry dell,
Chimed thee this rune hersell:
    "Balow, my boy!"

Soe, bonnie, dinna greit;
Moder doth rock her sweete,--
    Balow, my boy!
Give mee thy lyttel hand,
Moder will hold it and
Lead thee to balow land,--
    Balow, my boy!

Keep me, I pray, in wisdom's way
  That I may truths eternal seek;
I need protecting care to-day,--
  My purse is light, my flesh is weak.
So banish from my erring heart
  All baleful appetites and hints
Of Satan's fascinating art,
  Of first editions, and of prints.
Direct me in some godly walk
  Which leads away from bookish strife,
That I with pious deed and talk
  May extra-illustrate my life.

But if, O Lord, it pleaseth Thee
  To keep me in temptation's way,
I humbly ask that I may be
  Most notably beset to-day;
Let my temptation be a book,
  Which I shall purchase, hold, and keep,
Whereon when other men shall look,
  They'll wail to know I got it cheap.
Oh, let it such a volume be
  As in rare copperplates abounds,
Large paper, clean, and fair to see,
  Uncut, unique, unknown to Lowndes.

Sometime there ben a lyttel boy
  That wolde not renne and play,
And helpless like that little tyke
  Ben allwais in the way.
"Goe, make you merrie with the rest,"
  His weary moder cried;
But with a frown he catcht her gown
  And hong untill her side.

That boy did love his moder well,
  Which spake him faire, I ween;
He loved to stand and hold her hand
  And ken her with his een;
His cosset bleated in the croft,
  His toys unheeded lay,--
He wolde not goe, but, tarrying soe,
  Ben allwais in the way.

Godde loveth children and doth gird
  His throne with soche as these,
And He doth smile in plaisaunce while
  They cluster at His knees;
And sometime, when He looked on earth
  And watched the bairns at play,
He kenned with joy a lyttel boy
  Ben allwais in the way.

And then a moder felt her heart
  How that it ben to-torne,--
She kissed eche day till she ben gray
  The shoon he used to worn;
No bairn let hold untill her gown,
  Nor played upon the floore,--
Godde's was the joy; a lyttel boy
  Ben in the way no more!

It is very aggravating
  To hear the solemn prating
Of the fossils who are stating
That old Horace was a prude;
  When we know that with the ladies
He was always raising Hades,
And with many an escapade his
  Best productions are imbued.

There's really not much harm in a
  Large number of his carmina,
But these people find alarm in a
  Few records of his acts;
So they'd squelch the muse caloric,
And to students sophomoric
They d present as metaphoric
  What old Horace meant for facts.

We have always thought 'em lazy;
Now we adjudge 'em crazy!
Why, Horace was a daisy
  That was very much alive!
And the wisest of us know him
As his Lydia verses show him,--
Go, read that virile poem,--
  It is No. 25.

He was a very owl, sir,
And starting out to prowl, sir,
You bet he made Rome howl, sir,
  Until he filled his date;
With a massic-laden ditty
And a classic maiden pretty
He painted up the city,
  And Maecenas paid the freight!

"Give me my bow," said Robin Hood,
  "An arrow give to me;
And where 't is shot mark thou that spot,
  For there my grave shall be."

Then Little John did make no sign,
  And not a word he spake;
But he smiled, altho' with mickle woe
  His heart was like to break.

He raised his master in his arms,
  And set him on his knee;
And Robin's eyes beheld the skies,
  The shaws, the greenwood tree.

The brook was babbling as of old,
  The birds sang full and clear,
And the wild-flowers gay like a carpet lay
  In the path of the timid deer.

"O Little John," said Robin Hood,
  "Meseemeth now to be
Standing with you so stanch and true
  Under the greenwood tree.

"And all around I hear the sound
  Of Sherwood long ago,
And my merry men come back again,--
  You know, sweet friend, you know!

"Now mark this arrow; where it falls,
  When I am dead dig deep,
And bury me there in the greenwood where
  I would forever sleep."

He twanged his bow. Upon its course
  The clothyard arrow sped,
And when it fell in yonder dell,
  Brave Robin Hood was dead.

The sheriff sleeps in a marble vault,
  The king in a shroud of gold;
And upon the air with a chanted pray'r
  Mingles the mock of mould.

But the deer draw to the shady pool,
  The birds sing blithe and free,
And the wild-flow'rs bloom o'er a hidden tomb
  Under the greenwood tree.

Last night, whiles that the curfew bell ben ringing,
I heard a moder to her dearie singing
          "Lollyby, lolly, lollyby."
And presently that chylde did cease hys weeping,
And on his moder's breast did fall a-sleeping,
         To "lolly, lolly, lollyby."

Faire ben the chylde unto his moder clinging,
But fairer yet the moder's gentle singing,--
           "Lollyby, lolly, lollyby."
And angels came and kisst the dearie smiling
In dreems while him hys moder ben beguiling
        With "lolly, lolly, lollyby!"

Then to my harte saies I, "Oh, that thy beating
Colde be assuaged by some swete voice repeating
        'Lollyby, lolly, lollyby;'
That like this lyttel chylde I, too, ben sleeping
With plaisaunt phantasies about me creeping,
        To 'lolly, lolly, lollyby!'"

Sometime--mayhap when curfew bells are ringing--
A weary harte shall heare straunge voices singing,
        "Lollyby, lolly, lollyby;"
Sometime, mayhap, with Chrysts love round me streaming,
I shall be lulled into eternal dreeming
        With "lolly, lolly, lollyby."

Us two wuz boys when we fell out,--
  Nigh to the age uv my youngest now;
Don't rec'lect what't wuz about,
  Some small deeff'rence, I'll allow.
Lived next neighbors twenty years,
  A-hatin' each other, me 'nd Jim,--
He havin' _his_ opinyin uv _me_,
  'Nd _I_ havin' _my_ opinyin uv _him_.

Grew up together 'nd would n't speak,
  Courted sisters, 'nd marr'd 'em, too;
Tended same meetin'-house oncet a week,
  A-hatin' each other through 'nd through!
But when Abe Linkern asked the West
  F'r soldiers, we answered,--me 'nd Jim,--
_He_ havin' _his_ opinyin uv _me_,
  'Nd _I_ havin' _my_ opinyin uv _him_.

But down in Tennessee one night
  Ther' wuz sound uv firin' fur away,
'Nd the sergeant allowed ther' 'd be a fight
  With the Johnnie Rebs some time nex' day;
'Nd as I wuz thinkin' uv Lizzie 'nd home
  Jim stood afore me, long 'nd slim,--
_He_ havin' _his_ opinyin uv _me_,
  'Nd _I_ havin' _my_ opinyin uv _him_.

Seemed like we knew there wuz goin' to be
  Serious trouble f'r me 'nd him;
Us two shuck hands, did Jim 'nd me,
  But never a word from me or Jim!
He went _his_ way 'nd _I_ went _mine_,
  'Nd into the battle's roar went we,--
_I_ havin' _my_ opinyin uv Jim,
  'Nd _he_ havin' _his_ opinyin uv _me_.

Jim never come back from the war again,
  But I ha' n't forgot that last, last night
When, waitin' f'r orders, us two men
  Made up 'nd shuck hands, afore the fight.
'Nd, after it all, it's soothin' to know
  That here _I_ be 'nd yonder's Jim,--
_He_ havin' _his_ opinyin uv _me_,
'Nd _I_ havin' _my_ opinyin uv _him_.


One night a tiny dewdrop fell
  Into the bosom of a rose,--
"Dear little one, I love thee well,
  Be ever here thy sweet repose!"

Seeing the rose with love bedight,
  The envious sky frowned dark, and then
Sent forth a messenger of light
  And caught the dewdrop up again.

"Oh, give me back my heavenly child,--
  My love!" the rose in anguish cried;
Alas! the sky triumphant smiled,
  And so the flower, heart-broken, died.

A moonbeam floateth from the skies,
Whispering, "Heigho, my dearie!
I would spin a web before your eyes,--
A beautiful web of silver light,
Wherein is many a wondrous sight
Of a radiant garden leagues away,
Where the softly tinkling lilies sway,
And the snow-white lambkins are at play,--
    Heigho, my dearie!"

A brownie stealeth from the vine
    Singing, "Heigho, my dearie!
And will you hear this song of mine,--
A song of the land of murk and mist
Where bideth the bud the dew hath kist?
Then let the moonbeam's web of light
Be spun before thee silvery white,
And I shall sing the livelong night,--
    Heigho, my dearie!"

The night wind speedeth from the sea,
    Murmuring, "Heigho, my dearie!
I bring a mariner's prayer for thee;
So let the moonbeam veil thine eyes,
And the brownie sing thee lullabies;
But I shall rock thee to and fro,
Kissing the brow _he_ loveth so,
And the prayer shall guard thy bed, I trow,--
    Heigho, my dearie!"

This talk about the journalists that run the East is bosh,
We've got a Western editor that's little, but, O gosh!
He lives here in Mizzoora where the people are so set
In ante-bellum notions that they vote for Jackson yet;
But the paper he is running makes the rusty fossils swear,--
The smartest, likeliest paper that is printed anywhere!
And, best of all, the paragraphs are pointed as a tack,
  And that's because they emanate
    From little Mack.

In architecture he is what you'd call a chunky man,
As if he'd been constructed on the summer cottage plan;
He has a nose like Bonaparte; and round his mobile mouth
Lies all the sensuous languor of the children of the South;
His dealings with reporters who affect a weekly bust
Have given to his violet eyes a shadow of distrust;
In glorious abandon his brown hair wanders back
    From the grand Websterian forehead
        Of little Mack.

No matter what the item is, if there's an item in it,
You bet your life he's on to it and nips it in a minute!
From multifarious nations, countries, monarchies, and lands,
From Afric's sunny fountains and India's coral strands,
From Greenland's icy mountains and Siloam's shady rills,
He gathers in his telegrams, and Houser pays the bills;
What though there be a dearth of news, he has a happy knack
    Of scraping up a lot of scoops,
        Does little Mack.

And learning? Well he knows the folks of every tribe and age
That ever played a part upon this fleeting human stage;
His intellectual system's so extensive and so greedy
That, when it comes to records, he's a walkin' cyclopedy;
For having studied (and digested) all the books a-goin',
It stands to reason he must know about all's worth a-knowin'!
So when a politician with a record's on the track,
    We're apt to hear some history
        From little Mack.

And when a fellow-journalist is broke and needs a twenty,
Who's allus ready to whack up a portion of his plenty?
Who's allus got a wallet that's as full of sordid gain
As his heart is full of kindness and his head is full of brain?
Whose bowels of compassion will in-va-ri-a-bly move
Their owner to those courtesies which plainly, surely prove
That he's the kind of person that never does go back
  On a fellow that's in trouble?
    Why, little Mack!

I've heard 'em tell of Dana, and of Bonner, and of Reid,
Of Johnnie Cockerill, who, I'll own, is very smart indeed;
Yet I don't care what their renown or influence may be,
One metropolitan exchange is quite enough for me!
So keep your Danas, Bonners, Reids, your Cockerills, and the rest,
The woods is full of better men all through this woolly West;
For all that sleek, pretentious, Eastern editorial pack
    We wouldn't swap the shadow of
       Our little Mack!

I see you, Maister Bawsy-brown,
  Through yonder lattice creepin';
You come for cream and to gar me dream,
  But you dinna find me sleepin'.
The moonbeam, that upon the floor
  Wi' crickets ben a-jinkin',
Now steals away fra' her bonnie play--
  Wi' a rosier blie, I'm thinkin'.

I saw you, Maister Bawsy-brown,
  When the blue bells went a-ringin'
For the merrie fays o' the banks an' braes,
  And I kenned your bonnie singin';
The gowans gave you honey sweets,
  And the posies on the heather
Dript draughts o' dew for the faery crew
  That danct and sang together.

But posie-bloom an' simmer-dew
  And ither sweets o' faery
C'u'd na gae down wi' Bawsy-brown,
  Sae nigh to Maggie's dairy!
My pantry shelves, sae clean and white,
  Are set wi' cream and cheeses,--
Gae, gin you will, an' take your fill
  Of whatsoever pleases.

Then wave your wand aboon my een
  Until they close awearie,
And the night be past sae sweet and fast
  Wi' dreamings o' my dearie.
But pinch the wench in yonder room,
  For she's na gude nor bonnie,--
Her shelves be dust and her pans be rust,
  And she winkit at my Johnnie!

Full many a sinful notion
  Conceived of foreign powers
Has come across the ocean
  To harm this land of ours;
And heresies called fashions
  Have modesty effaced,
And baleful, morbid passions
  Corrupt our native taste.
O tempora! O mores!
  What profanations these
That seek to dim the glories
  Of apple-pie and cheese!

I'm glad my education
  Enables me to stand
Against the vile temptation
  Held out on every hand;
Eschewing all the tittles
  With vanity replete,
I'm loyal to the victuals
  Our grandsires used to eat!
I'm glad I've got three willing boys
  To hang around and tease
Their mother for the filling joys
  Of apple-pie and cheese!

Your flavored creams and ices
  And your dainty angel-food
Are mighty fine devices
  To regale the dainty dude;
Your terrapin and oysters,
  With wine to wash 'em down,
Are just the thing for roisters
  When painting of the town;
No flippant, sugared notion
  Shall _my_ appetite appease,
Or bate my soul's devotion
  To apple-pie and cheese!

The pie my Julia makes me
  (God bless her Yankee ways!)
On memory's pinions takes me
  To dear Green Mountain days;
And seems like I see Mother
  Lean on the window-sill,
A-handin' me and brother
  What she knows 'll keep us still;
And these feelings are so grateful,
  Says I, "Julia, if you please,
I'll take another plateful
  Of that apple-pie and cheese!"

And cheese! No alien it, sir,
  That's brought across the sea,--
No Dutch antique, nor Switzer,
  Nor glutinous de Brie;
There's nothing I abhor so
  As mawmets of this ilk--
Give _me_ the harmless morceau
  That's made of true-blue milk!
No matter what conditions
   Dyspeptic come to feaze,
The best of all physicians
  Is apple-pie and cheese!

Though ribalds may decry 'em,
  For these twin boons we stand,
Partaking thrice per diem
  Of their fulness out of hand;
No enervating fashion
  Shall cheat us of our right
To gratify our passion
  With a mouthful at a bite!
We'll cut it square or bias,
  Or any way we please,
And faith shall justify us
  When we carve our pie and cheese!

De gustibus, 't is stated,
  Non disputandum est.
Which meaneth, when translated,
  That all is for the best.
So let the foolish choose 'em
  The vapid sweets of sin,
I will not disabuse 'em
  Of the heresy they're in;
But I, when I undress me
  Each night, upon my knees
Will ask the Lord to bless me
  With apple-pie and cheese!

Krinken was a little child,--
It was summer when he smiled.
Oft the hoary sea and grim
Stretched its white arms out to him,
Calling, "Sun-child, come to me;
Let me warm my heart with thee!"
But the child heard not the sea,
Calling, yearning evermore
For the summer on the shore.

Krinken on the beach one day
Saw a maiden Nis at play;
On the pebbly beach she played
In the summer Krinken made.
Fair, and very fair, was she,
Just a little child was he.
"Krinken," said the maiden Nis,
"Let me have a little kiss,
Just a kiss, and go with me
To the summer-lands that be
Down within the silver sea."

Krinken was a little child--
By the maiden Nis beguiled,
Hand in hand with her went he,
And 'twas summer in the sea.
And the hoary sea and grim
To its bosom folded him--
Clasped and kissed the little form,
And the ocean's heart was warm.

Now the sea calls out no more;
It is winter on the shore,--
Winter where that little child
Made sweet summer when he smiled;
Though 'tis summer on the sea
Where with maiden Nis went he,--
Summer, summer evermore,--
It is winter on the shore,
Winter, winter evermore.
Of the summer on the deep
Come sweet visions in my sleep:
_His_ fair face lifts from the sea,
_His_ dear voice calls out to me,--
These my dreams of summer be.

Krinken was a little child,
By the maiden Nis beguiled;
Oft the hoary sea and grim
Reached its longing arms to him,
Crying, "Sun-child, come to me;
Let me warm my heart with thee!"
But the sea calls out no more;
It is winter on the shore,--
Winter, cold and dark and wild;
Krinken was a little child,--
It was summer when he smiled;
Down he went into the sea,
And the winter bides with me.
Just a little child was he.

There, there, poor dog, my faithful friend,
  Pay you no heed unto my sorrow:
But feast to-day while yet you may,--
  Who knows but we shall starve to-morrow!

"Give us a tune," the foemen cried,
  In one of their profane caprices;
I bade them "No"--they frowned, and, lo!
  They dashed this innocent in pieces!

This fiddle was the village pride--
  The mirth of every fête enhancing;
Its wizard art set every heart
  As well as every foot to dancing.

How well the bridegroom knew its voice,
  As from its strings its song went gushing!
Nor long delayed the promised maid
  Equipped for bridal, coy and blushing.

Why, it discoursed so merrily,
  It quickly banished all dejection;
And yet, when pressed, our priest confessed
  I played with pious circumspection.

And though, in patriotic song,
  It was our guide, compatriot, teacher,
I never thought the foe had wrought
  His fury on the helpless creature!

But there, poor dog, my faithful friend,
  Pay you no heed unto my sorrow;
I prithee take this paltry cake,--
  Who knows but we shall starve to-morrow!

Ah, who shall lead the Sunday choir
  As this old fiddle used to do it?
Can vintage come, with this voice dumb
  That used to bid a welcome to it?

It soothed the weary hours of toil,
  It brought forgetfulness to debtors;
Time and again from wretched men
  It struck oppression's galling fetters.

No man could hear its voice, and hate;
  It stayed the teardrop at its portal;
With that dear thing I was a king
  As never yet was monarch mortal!

Now has the foe--the vandal foe--
  Struck from my hands their pride and glory;
There let it lie! In vengeance, I
  Shall wield another weapon, gory!

And if, O countrymen, I fall,
  Beside our grave let this be spoken:
"No foe of France shall ever dance
  Above the heart and fiddle, broken!"

So come, poor dog, my faithful friend,
  I prithee do not heed my sorrow,
But feast to-day while yet you may,
  For we are like to starve to-morrow.

A little peach in the orchard grew,--
A little peach of emerald hue;
Warmed by the sun and wet by the dew,
          It grew.

One day, passing that orchard through,
That little peach dawned on the view
Of Johnny Jones and his sister Sue--
          Them two.

Up at that peach a club they threw--
Down from the stem on which it grew
Fell that peach of emerald hue.
          Mon Dieu!

John took a bite and Sue a chew,
And then the trouble began to brew,--
Trouble the doctor couldn't subdue.
          Too true!

Under the turf where the daisies grew
They planted John and his sister Sue,
And their little souls to the angels flew,--
          Boo hoo!

What of that peach of the emerald hue,
Warmed by the sun, and wet by the dew?
Ah, well, its mission on earth is through.
          Adieu!

O fountain of Bandusia,
  Whence crystal waters flow,
With garlands gay and wine I'll pay
  The sacrifice I owe;
A sportive kid with budding horns
  I have, whose crimson blood
Anon shall dye and sanctify
  Thy cool and babbling flood.

O fountain of Bandusia,
  The dog-star's hateful spell
No evil brings unto the springs
  That from thy bosom well;
Here oxen, wearied by the plough,
  The roving cattle here,
Hasten in quest of certain rest
  And quaff thy gracious cheer.

O fountain of Bandusia,
  Ennobled shalt thou be,
For I shall sing the joys that spring
  Beneath yon ilex-tree;
Yes, fountain of Bandusia,
  Posterity shall know
The cooling brooks that from thy nooks
  Singing and dancing go!

  I hear Thy voice, dear Lord;
I hear it by the stormy sea
  When winter nights are black and wild,
And when, affright, I call to Thee;
  It calms my fears and whispers me,
"Sleep well, my child."

  I hear Thy voice, dear Lord,
In singing winds, in falling snow,
  The curfew chimes, the midnight bell.
"Sleep well, my child," it murmurs low;
"The guardian angels come and go,--
  O child, sleep well!"

  I hear Thy voice, dear Lord,
Ay, though the singing winds be stilled,
  Though hushed the tumult of the deep,
My fainting heart with anguish chilled
By Thy assuring tone is thrilled,--
  "Fear not, and sleep!"

  Speak on--speak on, dear Lord!
And when the last dread night is near,
  With doubts and fears and terrors wild,
Oh, let my soul expiring hear
Only these words of heavenly cheer,
  "Sleep well, my child!"

The fire upon the hearth is low,
  And there is stillness everywhere,
  While like winged spirits, here and there,
The firelight shadows fluttering go.
And as the shadows round me creep,
  A childish treble breaks the gloom,
  And softly from a further room
Comes, "Now I lay me down to sleep."

And somehow, with that little prayer
  And that sweet treble in my ears,
  My thoughts go back to distant years
And linger with a loved one there;
And as I hear my child's amen,
  My mother's faith comes back to me,--
  Crouched at her side I seem to be,
And Mother holds my hands again.

Oh, for an hour in that dear place!
  Oh, for the peace of that dear time!
  Oh, for that childish trust sublime!
Oh, for a glimpse of Mother's face!
Yet, as the shadows round me creep,
  I do not seem to be alone,--
  Sweet magic of that treble tone,
And "Now I lay me down to sleep."

Shall I woo the one or other?
  Both attract me--more's the pity!
Pretty is the widowed mother,
  And the daughter, too, is pretty.

When I see that maiden shrinking,
  By the gods I swear I'll get 'er!
But anon I fall to thinking
  That the mother 'll suit me better!

So, like any idiot ass
  Hungry for the fragrant fodder,
Placed between two bales of grass,
  Lo, I doubt, delay, and dodder!

I count my treasures o'er with care.--
  The little toy my darling knew,
  A little sock of faded hue,
A little lock of golden hair.

Long years ago this holy time,
  My little one--my all to me--
  Sat robed in white upon my knee
And heard the merry Christmas chime.

"Tell me, my little golden-head,
  If Santa Claus should come to-night,
  What shall he bring my baby bright,--
What treasure for my boy?" I said.

And then he named this little toy,
  While in his round and mournful eyes
  There came a look of sweet surprise,
That spake his quiet, trustful joy.

And as he lisped his evening prayer
  He asked the boon with childish grace;
  Then, toddling to the chimney-place,
He hung this little stocking there.

That night, while lengthening shadows crept,
  I saw the white-winged angels come
  With singing to our lowly home
And kiss my darling as he slept.

They must have heard his little prayer,
  For in the morn, with rapturous face,
  He toddled to the chimney-place,
And found this little treasure there.

They came again one Christmas-tide,--
  That angel host, so fair and white!
  And singing all that glorious night,
They lured my darling from my side.

A little sock, a little toy,
  A little lock of golden hair,
  The Christmas music on the air,
A watching for my baby boy!

But if again that angel train
  And golden-head come back for me,
  To bear me to Eternity,
My watching will not be in vain!

    Though care and strife
        Elsewhere be rife,
Upon my word I do not heed 'em;
        In bed I lie
        With books hard by,
And with increasing zest I read 'em.

        Propped up in bed,
        So much I've read
Of musty tomes that I've a headful
        Of tales and rhymes
        Of ancient times,
Which, wife declares, are "simply dreadful!"

        They give me joy
        Without alloy;
And isn't that what books are made for?
        And yet--and yet--
        (Ah, vain regret!)
I would to God they all were paid for!

        No festooned cup
        Filled foaming up
Can lure me elsewhere to confound me;
        Sweeter than wine
        This love of mine
For these old books I see around me!

        A plague, I say,
        On maidens gay;
I'll weave no compliments to tell 'em!
        Vain fool I were,
        Did I prefer
Those dolls to these old friends in vellum!

        At dead of night
        My chamber's bright
Not only with the gas that's burning,
        But with the glow
        Of long ago,--
Of beauty back from eld returning.

        Fair women's looks
        I see in books,
I see _them_, and I hear their laughter,--
        Proud, high-born maids,
        Unlike the jades
Which men-folk now go chasing after!

        Herein again
        Speak valiant men
Of all nativities and ages;
        I hear and smile
        With rapture while
I turn these musty, magic pages.

        The sword, the lance,
        The morris dance,
The highland song, the greenwood ditty,
        Of these I read,
        Or, when the need,
My Miller grinds me grist that's gritty!

        When of such stuff
        We've had enough,
Why, there be other friends to greet us;
        We'll moralize
        In solemn wise
With Plato or with Epictetus.

        Sneer as you may,
        _I'm_ proud to say
That I, for one, am very grateful
        To Heaven, that sends
        These genial friends
To banish other friendships hateful!

        And when I'm done,
        I'd have no son
Pounce on these treasures like a vulture;
        Nay, give them half
        My epitaph,
And let them share in my sepulture.

        Then, when the crack
        Of doom rolls back
The marble and the earth that hide me,
        I'll smuggle home
        Each precious tome,
Without a fear my wife shall chide me!

The Blue Horizon wuz a mine us fellers all thought well uv,
And there befell the episode I now perpose to tell uv;
'T wuz in the year uv sixty-nine,--somewhere along in summer,
There hove in sight one afternoon a new and curious comer;
His name wuz Silas Pettibone,--a' artist by perfession,
With a kit of tools and a big mustache and a pipe in his possession.
He told us, by our leave, he 'd kind uv like to make some sketches
Uv the snowy peaks, 'nd the foamin' crick, 'nd the distant mountain
         stretches;
"You're welkim, sir," sez we, although this scenery dodge seemed to us
A waste uv time where scenery wuz already sooper-_floo_-us.

All through the summer Pettibone kep' busy at his sketchin',
At daybreak off for Eagle Pass, and home at nightfall, fetchin'
That everlastin' book uv his with spider-lines all through it;
Three-Fingered Hoover used to say there warn't no meanin' to it.
"Gol durn a man," sez he to him, "whose shif'less hand is sot at
A-drawin' hills that's full uv quartz that's pinin' to be got at!"
"Go on," sez Pettibone, "go on, if joshin' gratifies ye;
But one uv these fine times I'll show ye sumthin' will surprise ye!"
The which remark led us to think--although he didn't say it
That Pettibone wuz owin' us a gredge 'nd meant to pay it.

One evenin' as we sat around the Restauraw de Casey,
A-singin' songs 'nd tellin' yarns the which wuz sumwhat racy,
In come that feller Pettibone, 'nd sez, "With your permission,
I'd like to put a picture I have made on exhibition."
He sot the picture on the bar 'nd drew aside its curtain,
Sayin', "I reckon you'll allow as how _that's_ art, f'r certain!"
And then we looked, with jaws agape, but nary word wuz spoken,
And f'r a likely spell the charm uv silence wuz unbroken
Till presently, as in a dream, remarked Three-Fingered Hoover:
"Onless I am mistaken, this is Pettibone's shef doover!"

It wuz a face--a human face--a woman's, fair 'nd tender
Sot gracefully upon a neck white as a swan's, and slender;
The hair wuz kind uv sunny, 'nd the eyes wuz sort uv dreamy,
The mouth wuz half a-smilin', 'nd the cheeks wuz soft 'nd creamy;
It seemed like she wuz lookin' off into the west out yonder,
And seemed like, while she looked, we saw her eyes grow softer, fonder,
Like, lookin' off into the west, where mountain mists wuz fallin',
She saw the face she longed to see and heerd his voice a-callin';
"Hooray!" we cried,--"a woman in the camp uv Blue Horizon!
Step right up, Colonel Pettibone, 'nd nominate your pizen!"

A curious situation,--one deservin' uv your pity,
No human, livin', female thing this side of Denver City!
But jest a lot uv husky men that lived on sand 'nd bitters,
Do you wonder that that woman's face consoled the lonesome critters?
And not a one but what it served in some way to remind him
Of a mother or a sister or a sweetheart left behind him;
And some looked back on happier days, and saw the old-time faces
And heerd the dear familiar sounds in old familiar places,--
A gracious touch of home. "Look here," sez Hoover, "ever'body
Quit thinkin' 'nd perceed at oncet to name his favorite toddy!"

It wuzn't long afore the news had spread the country over,
And miners come a-flockin' in like honey-bees to clover;
It kind uv did 'em good, they said, to feast their hungry eyes on
That picture uv Our Lady in the camp uv Blue Horizon.
But one mean cuss from Nigger Crick passed criticisms on 'er,
Leastwise we overheerd him call her Pettibone's madonner,
The which we did not take to be respectful to a lady,
So we hung him in a quiet spot that wuz cool 'nd dry 'nd shady;
Which same might not have been good law, but it _wuz_ the right manoeuvre
To give the critics due respect for Pettibone's shef doover.

Gone is the camp,--yes, years ago the Blue Horizon busted,
And every mother's son uv us got up one day 'nd dusted,
While Pettibone perceeded East with wealth in his possession,
And went to Yurrup, as I heerd, to study his perfession;
So, like as not, you'll find him now a-paintin' heads 'nd faces
At Venus, Billy Florence, and the like I-talyun places.
But no sech face he'll paint again as at old Blue Horizon,
For I'll allow no sweeter face no human soul sot eyes on;
And when the critics talk so grand uv Paris 'nd the Loover,
I say, "Oh, but you orter seen the Pettibone shef doover!"



Upon a mountain height, far from the sea,
    I found a shell,
And to my listening ear the lonely thing
Ever a song of ocean seemed to sing,
    Ever a tale of ocean seemed to tell.

How came the shell upon that mountain height?
    Ah, who can say
Whether there dropped by some too careless hand,
Or whether there cast when Ocean swept the Land,
    Ere the Eternal had ordained the Day?

Strange, was it not? Far from its native deep,
    One song it sang,--
Sang of the awful mysteries of the tide,
Sang of the misty sea, profound and wide,
    Ever with echoes of the ocean rang.

And as the shell upon the mountain height
    Sings of the sea,
So do I ever, leagues and leagues away,
So do I ever, wandering where I may,
    Sing, O my home! sing, O my home! of thee.

Aha! a traitor in the camp,
  A rebel strangely bold,
A lisping, laughing, toddling scamp,
  Not more than four years old!

To think that I, who've ruled alone
  So proudly in the past,
Should be ejected from my throne
  By my own son at last!

He trots his treason to and fro,
  As only babies can,
And says he'll be his mamma's beau
  When he's a "gweat, big man"!

You stingy boy! you've always had
  A share in mamma's heart;
Would you begrudge your poor old dad
  The tiniest little part?

That mamma, I regret to see,
  Inclines to take your part,
As if a dual monarchy
  Should rule her gentle heart!

But when the years of youth have sped,
  The bearded man, I trow,
Will quite forget he ever said
  He'd be his mamma's beau.

Renounce your treason, little son,
  Leave mamma's heart to me;
For there will come another one
  To claim your loyalty.

And when that other comes to you,
  God grant her love may shine
Through all your life, as fair and true
  As mamma's does through mine!

Fair is the castle up on the hill
      Hushaby, sweet my own!
The night is fair, and the waves are still,
And the wind is singing to you and to me
In this lowly home beside the sea
      Hushaby, sweet my own!

On yonder hill is store of wealth
      Hushaby, sweet my own!
And revellers drink to a little one's health;
But you and I bide night and day
For the other love that has sailed away
      Hushaby, sweet my own!

See not, dear eyes, the forms that creep
      Ghostlike, O my own!
Out of the mists of the murmuring deep;
Oh, see them not and make no cry
Till the angels of death have passed us by
      Hushaby, sweet my own!

Ah, little they reck of you and me
      Hushaby, sweet my own!
In our lonely home beside the sea;
They seek the castle up on the hill,
And there they will do their ghostly will
      Hushaby, O my own!

Here by the sea a mother croons
      "Hushaby, sweet my own!"
In yonder castle a mother swoons
While the angels go down to the misty deep,
Bearing a little one fast asleep
      Hushaby, sweet my own!

"Sweetheart, take this," a soldier said,
  "And bid me brave good-by;
It may befall we ne'er shall wed,
  But love can never die.
Be steadfast in thy troth to me,
  And then, whate'er my lot,
'My soul to God, my heart to thee,'
  Sweetheart, forget me not!"

The maiden took the tiny flower
  And nursed it with her tears:
Lo! he who left her in that hour
  Came not in after years.
Unto a hero's death he rode
  'Mid shower of fire and shot;
But in the maiden's heart abode
  The flower, forget-me-not.

And when _he_ came not with the rest
  From out the years of blood,
Closely unto her widowed breast
  She pressed a faded bud;
Oh, there is love and there is pain,
  And there is peace, God wot,
And these dear three do live again
  In sweet forget-me-not.

'T is to an unmarked grave to-day
  That I should love to go,
Whether he wore the blue or gray,
  What need that we should know?
"He loved a woman," let us say,
  And on that sacred spot,
To woman's love, that lives for aye,
  We'll strew forget-me-not.

Lofty and enduring is the monument I've reared,
  Come, tempests, with your bitterness assailing;
And thou, corrosive blasts of time, by all things mortal feared,
  Thy buffets and thy rage are unavailing!

I shall not altogether die; by far my greater part
  Shall mock man's common fate in realms infernal;
My works shall live as tributes to my genius and my art,
  My works shall be my monument eternal!

While this great Roman empire stands and gods protect our fanes,
  Mankind with grateful hearts shall tell the story,
How one most lowly born upon the parched Apulian plains
  First raised the native lyric muse to glory.

Assume, revered Melpomene, the proud estate I've won,
  And, with thine own dear hand the meed supplying,
Bind thou about the forehead of thy celebrated son
  The Delphic laurel-wreath of fame undying!

Lie in my arms, Ailsie, my bairn,
  Lie in my arms and dinna greit;
Long time been past syn I kenned you last,
  But my harte been allwais the same, my swete.

Ailsie, I colde not say you ill,
  For out of the mist of your bitter tears,
And the prayers that rise from your bonnie eyes
  Cometh a promise of oder yeres.

I mind the time when we lost our bairn,
  Do you ken that time? A wambling tot,
You wandered away ane simmer day,
  And we hunted and called, and found you not.

I promised God, if He'd send you back,
  Alwaies to keepe and to love you, childe;
And I'm thinking again of that promise when
  I see you creep out of the storm sae wild.

You came back then as you come back now,
  Your kirtle torn and your face all white;
And you stood outside and knockit and cried,
  Just as you, dearie, did to-night.

Oh, never a word of the cruel wrang,
  That has faded your cheek and dimmed your ee;
And never a word of the fause, fause lord,
  Only a smile and a kiss for me.

Lie in my arms, as long, long syne,
  And sleepe on my bosom, deere wounded thing,
I'm nae sae glee as I used to be,
  Or I'd sing you the songs I used to sing.

But Ile kemb my fingers thro' y'r haire,
  And nane shall know, but you and I,
Of the love and the faith that came to us baith
  When Ailsie, my bairn, came home to die.

Out on the mountain over the town,
  All night long, all night long,
The trolls go up and the trolls go down,
  Bearing their packs and crooning a song;
And this is the song the hill-folk croon,
As they trudge in the light of the misty moon,
This is ever their dolorous tune:
"Gold, gold! ever more gold,
      Bright red gold for dearie!"

Deep in the hill the yeoman delves
  All night long, all night long;
None but the peering, furtive elves
  See his toil and hear his song;
Merrily ever the cavern rings
As merrily ever his pick he swings,
And merrily ever this song he sings:
"Gold, gold! ever more gold,
      Bright red gold for dearie!"

Mother is rocking thy lowly bed
  All night long, all night long,
Happy to smooth thy curly head
  And to hold thy hand and to sing her song;
'T is not of the hill-folk, dwarfed and old,
Nor the song of the yeoman, stanch and bold,
And the burden it beareth is not of gold;
But it's "Love, love!--nothing but love,
      Mother's love for dearie!"

There were three cavaliers that went over the Rhine,
And gayly they called to the hostess for wine.
"And where is thy daughter? We would she were here,
Go fetch us that maiden to gladden our cheer!"

"I'll fetch thee thy goblets full foaming," she said,
"But in yon darkened chamber the maiden lies dead."
And lo! as they stood in the doorway, the white
Of a shroud and a dead shrunken face met their sight.

Then the first cavalier breathed a pitiful sigh,
And the throb of his heart seemed to melt in his eye,
And he cried, "Hadst thou lived, O my pretty white rose,
I ween I had loved thee and wed thee--who knows?"
