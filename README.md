# LSTM-Poetry-Generator
This code is an implementation of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model trained over collection of text (poems) data to generate poem like texts. Data set is collected from project [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and trained over single layer LSTM net. Model Learns to predict characters in a reasonably good fashion.
